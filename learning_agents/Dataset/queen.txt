A Day At The Races
Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy
I can dim the lights and sing you songs full of sad things
We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be your Valentino just for you

Ooh love - Ooh Loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy -
Set my alarm, turn on my charm
That's because I'm a good old-fashioned loverboy 

Ooh let me feel your heartbeat (grow faster, faster)
Ooh Ooh let me feel your love heat
Come on and sit on my hot-seat of love
And tell me how do you feel right after-all
I'd like for you and I to go romancing

Say the word - your wish is my command
Ooh love - Ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy
Write my letter
Feel much better
I'll use my fancy patter on the telephone
When I'm not with you
I think of you always
I miss you -
(I miss those long hot summer nights)
When I'm not with you
Think of me always
I love you - Love you

Hey boy where do you get it from
Hey boy where did you go?
I learned my passion in the good old
fashioned school of loverboys-
Dining at the Ritz we'll meet at nine precisely
I will pay the bill, you taste the wine
Driving back in style, in my saloon will do quite nicely
Just take me back to yours that will be fine (Come on and get it)

Ooh love, Ooh loverboy
What're you doin' tonight, hey boy -
Everything's all right
Just hold on tight -
That's because I'm a good old fashioned loverboy
Long Away
You might believe in heaven
I would not care to say
For every star in heaven
There's a sad soul here today
Wake up in the morning with a good face
Stare at the moon all day
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
Does anyone care anyway
For all the prayers in heaven
So much of life's this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long long way behind us
Who knows when, now who knows where
Where the light of day will find us?
Look for the day

Take heart, my friend, we love you
Though it seems like you're alone
A million lights above you
Smile down upon your home
Hurry put your troubles in a suitcase
Come let the new child play
Lonely as a whisper on a star chase
I'm leaving here, I'm long away
For all the stars in heaven
I would not live
I could not live this way

Did we leave our way behind us
Such a long way behind us
Leave it for some hopeless lane
Such a long long way
such a long long way
such a long long away
I'm looking for
Still looking for that day
Somebody To Love
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief,
Lord!
Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end I take home my hard earned pay all on my own -
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord - somebody - somebody
Can anybody find me - somebody to love?

(He works hard)

Everyday - I try and I try and I try -
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah - yeah yeah yeah

Oh Lord
Somebody - somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm ok, I'm alright
Ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Teo Torriate (Let Us Cling Together)
When I'm gone
Don't stop to wonder if I ever think of you
The same moon shines
The same wind blows
For both of us, and time is but a paper moon. . . be not gone

Though I'm gone
It's just as though I hold the flower that touches you
A new life grows
The blossom knows
There's no one else could warm my heart as much as you. . . be not gone

Let us cling together as the years go by
Oh my love, my love
In the quiet of the night
Let our candle always burn
Let us never lose the lessons we have learned

The Millionaire Waltz
Bring out the charge of the love brigade
There is spring in the air once again
Drink to the sound of the song parade
There is music and love everywhere
Give a little love to me
Take a little love from me,
I want to share it with you
I feel like a millionaire

Once we were mad, we were happy
We spent all our days holding hands together
Do you remember, my love
How we danced and played
In the rain we laid
Could stay there, forever and ever

Now I am sad
You are so far away
I sit counting the hours day by day
Come back to me, how I long for your love
Come back to me - be happy like
we used to be Come back to me, oh my love
How I long for your love - won't you come back to me, yeah

Tie Your Mother Down
Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin' baby
Got my timin' right
Got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight my little
Schoolbabe

Your momma says you don't
And your Daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time 

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Lock your Daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight

You're such a dirty louse
Go get outta my house
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word
from those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Grousin' an' snipin'

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick (that's all right)
Tie your Mother down,
Tie your Mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

Your momma and your Daddy gonna
Plague me til I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a
Peace lovin' guy
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down. . .etc etc. . .
White Man
I'm a simple man
With a simple name
From this soil my people came
In this soil remain
Oh yeah. . .

And we made us our shoes
And we trod soft on the land
But the immigrant built roads
On our blood and sand
Oh yeah. . .

White man, white man
Don't you see the light behind your blackened skies
White man, white man
You took away sight to blind my simple eyes
White man, white man
Where you gonna hide
From the hell you've made?

Oh the red man knows war
With his hands and his knives
On the Bible you swore
Fought your battle with lies
Oh yeah. . .

Leave my body in shame
Leave my soul in disgrace
But by every God's name
Say your prayers for your race

White man, white man
Our country was green and all our rivers wide
White man, white man
You came with a gun and soon our children died
White man, white man
Don't you give a light for the blood you've shed? 

What is left of your dream?
Just the words on your stone
A man who learned how to teach
Then forget how to learn
You And I
Music is playing in the darkness
And a lantern goes swinging by
Shadows flickering
My heart's jittering
Just you and I

Not tonight
Come tomorrow
When everything's sunny and bright
No No No
Come tomorrow
Cos then we'll be waiting for the moonlight 

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

Laughter ringing in the darkness
People drinking for days gone by
Time don't mean a thing
When you're by my side
Please stay a while

You know I never could foresee the future years
You know I never could see
where life was leading me
But will we be together for ever
What will be my love, can't you see that I just don't know 

No no not tonight
Come tomorrow
When everything's gonna be alright
Wait and see
If tomorrow
We'll be as happy as we're feeling tonight 

We'll go walking in the moonlight
Walking in the moonlight

I can hear the music in the darkness
Floating softly to where to lie
No more questions now
Let's enjoy tonight
Just you and I
Just you and I
You Take My Breath Away
Look into my eyes and you'll see
I'm the only one
You've captured my love
Stolen my heart
Changed my life
Every time you make a move
You destroy my mind
And the way you touch
I lose control and shiver deep inside
You take my breath away

You can reduce me to tears
With a single sigh
Every breath that you take -
Any sound that you make
Is a whisper in my ear
I could give up all my life for just one kiss
I would surely die
If you dismiss me from your love
You take my breath away

So please don't go
Don't leave me here all by myself
I get ever so lonely from time to time
I will find you
Anywhere you go, I'll be right behind you
Right until the ends of the earth
I'll get no sleep till I find you to tell you
That you just take my breath
away

I will find you...etc
I'll get no sleep til I find you to
tell you when I've found you -
I love you

One Year Of Love
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone,
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart,
It's always a rainy day without you,
I'm a prisoner of love inside you -
I'm falling apart all around you - yeah.
My heart cries out to your heart,
I'm lonely but you can save me,
My hand reaches out for your hand,
I'm cold but you light the fire in me,
My lips search for your lips,
I'm hungry for your touch,
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment just surrender
And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much,
Oooh yes it hurtsm
And pain is so close to pleasure,
And all I can do is surrender to your love,
Just surrender to your love,

One day we love each other then we're fighting one another all the time,
When I was young and just getting started,
And people talked to me they sounded broken hearted,
Then I grew up and got my imagination
And all I wanted was to start a new releation,
So in love but love had a bad reaction,
I was looking for good old satisfaction,
But pain is all I got when all I needed was some love and affection,
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah,
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,
Pain and pleasure, Ooh, Ooh, pain and pleasure,
When your plans go wrong and you turn out the light,
But inside your mind you have to put up a fight,
Where are the answers that we're all searching for,
There's nothing in this world to be sure of anymore,
But if you're feeling happy someone else is always sad,
Let the sweetness on love wipe the tears from your facem
Ooh, ooh, pain is so close to pleasure, I told you so,
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,
Pain is so close to pleasure, yeah, yeah,
Sunshine and rainy weather go hand in hand together all your life,
All your life,

Who Wants To Live Forever
There's no time for us,
There's no place for us,
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever.....?
There's no chance for us,
It's all decided for us,
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who dares to love forever,
When love must die.

But touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,
And we can have forever,
And we can love forever,
Forever is our today,
Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever,
Forever is our today,
Who waits forever anyway?
A Night At The Opera
"'39" (May)
In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and sunny morn
The sweetest sight ever seen.

And the night followed dau
And the story tellers day
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried.

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew. 

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
For the earth is old and grey, to a new home we'll away
But my love this cannot be
For so many years have gone though I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes in your eyes cry to me.

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All the letters in the sand cannot heal me like your hand 

For my life
Still ahead
Pity Me.
"Bohemian Rhapsody" (Mercury)
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from reality.
Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.

Mama just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
Mama, ooh, Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time.
Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango.
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me.
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo, Galileo figaro
Magnifico. I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go.
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go.
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.
(Let me go.) Will not let you go.
(Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
(Oh mama mia, mama mia.) Mama mia, let me go.
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye.
So you think you can love me and leave me to die.
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me.

Any way the wind blows.
"Death On Two Legs (Dedicated To )" (Mercury)
You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money - you still want more, 

Misguided old mule
With your pigheaded rules
With your narrow - minded cronies who are fools of the first division- 

Death on two legs -
You're tearing me apart,
Death on two legs
You never had a heard of your own -

Kill joy, Bad guy,
Big talking, Small fry
You're just an old barrow - boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me,
Can you face me -

But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Feel good, are you satisfied

Do you feel like suicide (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night,
Do you feel good - Feel good!

Talk like a big business tycoon,
But you're just a hot - air balloon,
So no one gives you a damn,
You're just an overgrown school - boy
Let me tan your hide.

A dog with disease,
King of the 'sleaze'
Put your money where your mouth is Mr. Know all,
Was the fin on your back part of the deal...(shark!)

Death on two legs
You're tearing me apart
Death on two legs -
You never had a heart of your own,
(You never did, right from the start)

Insane you should be put inside,
You're a sewer - rat decaying in a cesspool of pride
Should be made unemployed
Then make yourself null - and - void,
Make me feel good
I feel good.
"Good Company" (May)
Take good core of what you've got
My father said to me
As he puffed his pipe and Baby B.
He dandled on his knee
Don't fool with fools who'll turn away
Keep all Good Company

Oo Hoo Oo Hoo
Take care of those you call your own
And keep Good Company

Soon I grew and happy too
My very good friends and me
We'd play all day and Sally J.
The girl from number four
And very soon I begged her won't you
Keep me Company

Now marriage is an insinuation sure
My wife and I our needs and nothing more All my friends by a year
By and by disappear
But we're safe enough behind our door.

I flourished in my humble trade
My reputation grew
The work devoured my waking hours
But when my time was through
Reward of all my efforts my own
Limited Company

I hardly noticed Sall as we
Pated Company
All through the years in the end it appears
There was never really anyone but me

Now I'm old I puff my pipe
But no-one's there to see

I ponder on the lesson of
My life's insanity
Take care of those you call your own
And Keep Good Company
"I'm In Love With My Car" (Taylor)
(Dedicated to Johnathan Harris, boy racer to the end)
The machine of a dream, such a clean machine,
With the pistons a pumpin', and the hubcaps all gleam.
When I'm holding your wheel,
All I hear is your gear,
When my hand's on your grease gun,
Oh it's like a disease son,
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar,
Such a thrill when your radials squeal.

Told my girl I just had to forget her,
Rather buy me a new cartburettor,
So she made tracks sayin' ths is the end now,
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now,

When I'm holding your wheel,
All I hear is your gear,
When I'm cruisin' in overdrive,
Don't have to listen to no run of the mill talk jive, 

I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,
I'm in love with my car, string back gloves in my automolove!
"Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon" (Mercury)
I go out to work on a Monday morning
Tuesday I go off to honeymoon
I'll be back again before it's time for Sunny-down,
I'll be lazing on a Sunday afternoon
Bicycling on every Wednesday evening
Thursday I go waltzing to the Zoo
I come from London town, I'm just an ordinary guy,
Fridays I go painting in the Louvre
I'm bound to be proposing on a Saturday night (There he goes again)
I'll be lazing on a Sunday
lazing on a Sunday

"Seaside Rendezvous" (Mercury)
Seaside - whenever you stroll along with me I'm merely contemplating what
you feel inside meanwhile I ask you to be my Clementine -
You say you'd have to tell your daddy if you can - I love you madly -
Let me imagination run away with you gladly -
A brand new angle - highly commendable - Seaside Rendezvous -

I feel so romantic - can we do it again
Can we do it again sometime,
Fantastic, c'est la vie mesdames et messieurs
And at the peak of the season, the
Mediterranean -, this time of year, it's so fashionable,
I feel like dancing - in the tain,
All I need is a volunteer -
Dancing - what a damn jolly good idea -
It's such a jollification - as a matter of fact, so tres charmant my dear -

Underneath the moonlight - together we'll sail across the sea -
Reminiscing every night
Meantime - I ask you to be my valentine
You say you do if you did but you daren't I'll be your Valentino -
We'll ride upon an omnibus and then the casino -
Get a new facial - so sensational -
Seaside Rendezvous - so adorable,
Seaside Rendezvous -
Seaside Rendezvous 
"Sweet Lady" (May)
You call me up and treat me like a dog
You call me up and tear me up inside
You've got me on a lead
You bring me down
You shout around
You don't believe that I'm alone.

Sweet Lady
Sweet Lady
Sweet Lady...Stay sweet.

You say
"You call me up and feed me all the lines
"You call me sweet lime I'm some kind of cheese
"Waiting on the shelf
"You eat me up
"You hold me down
"I'm just a fool to make you a home

"And you say
"Sweet lady
"Sweet lady
"Sweet lady...Stay sweet."

My Sweet lady
Though it seems like we wait forever
Stay sweet baby
Believe and we've got everything we need.
"The Prophet's Song" (May)
Oh Oh people of earth
Listen to the warning
The seer he said
Beware the storm that gathers here
Listen to the wise man.

I dreamed I saw on a moonlit stair
Spreading his hands on the multitude there
A man who cried for a love gone stale
And ice cold hearts of charity bare.
I watched as fear took the old men's gaze
Hopes of the yound in troubled graves
I see no day, I heard him say
So grey is the face of every mortal.

Oh Oh people of earth
Listen to the warning
The prophet he said
For soon the cold of night will fall
Summoned by your own hand.

Oh Oh children of the land
Quicken to the new life
Take my hand
Fly and find the new green bough
Return like the white dove.

He told of death as a done white haze
Taking the lost and the unloved babe
Late too late all the wretches run
These kinds of beasts now counting their days.
"You're My Best Friend" (Deacon)
Ooo. you make me live
whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooo, you make me live now honey
Ooo, you make me live

You're the best friend
that I ever had
I've been with you such a long time
You're my sunshine
And I want you to know
That my feelings are true
I really love you
You're my best friend

Ooo, you make me live

I've been wandering round
But I still come back to you
In rain or shine
You've stood by me girl
I'm happy, happy at home
You're my best friend.

You're the first one
When things turn out bad
You know I'll never be lonely
You're my only one
And I love
The things that you do
You're my best friend

Ooo, you make me live.

I'm happy, happy at home
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Ooo, you make me live
You, you're my best friend.
Love Of My Life" (Mercury)
Love of my life - you hurt me,
You broken my heart and now you leave me.
Love of my life can't you see,
Bring it back, bring it back,
Don't take it away from me, because you don't know, what it means to me.

Love of my life don't leave me,
You've stolen my love, you now desert me,
Love of my life can't you see,
Bring it back, bring it back,
Don't take it away from me because you don't know - what it means to me.

You won't remember -
When this is blown over
And everything's all by the way -
When I get older
I will be there by your side to remind you how I still love you - still love you.

Back - hurry back,
Don't take it away from me,
because you don't know what it means to me - Love of my life
Love of my life...

"Doing All Right" (May And Staffel)
Yesterday my life was in ruins
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Where will I be this time tomorrow?
Jump for joy and sinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Sitting waiting for the sign
Looking round for the words to say
Should be waiting for the skies to clear
If there were time in all the world
Sitting waiting for the sign
Anyway I got to hide away
Hide away

Yesterday my life was in ruins
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right
Doing all right
"Great King Rat" (Mercury)
Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphillis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care I don't care anyway
Come on come on the time is right
The man is evil and that is what I told you
And that's no lie oh no no no

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?
Let me show you

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Now listen all you people
Throw out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be a disciple
Don't listen to what you're mama says
Not a word not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're going to realise tomorrow 

No I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you?
Would you like to see?
"Keep Yourself Alive" (May)
I was told a million times
Of all the troubles in my way
Might he grow a little wiser
Little better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Now they say your folks are telling you
Be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep you satisfied

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me ev'rything I need
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Same as when I started

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive

"Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll" (Taylor)
Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and That's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall

Well I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could
happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the juke box blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll

Get you high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a big big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Gonna know just who you are
Look out
"My Fairy King" (Mercury)
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever
Lion's den with fellow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

<first voice> <Second Voice>
My fairy king can see things He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me Oh yeah he guides the winds

My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong
Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry no salt from sand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for the poor man's eyes 

Someone someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother mercury (mercury)
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run I cannot hide
"Ogre Battle" (Mercury)
Now once upon a time
An old man told me a fable
When the piper is gone
And the soup is cold upon the table
And if the black crow flies
Find a new destination
That is the sign

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to ogre battle fight

He gives a great big cry
And he can swallow up the ocean
With mighty tongue he catches flies
And the palm of his hand incredible size
One great big eye
Has to focus in your direction
Now the battle is won
Yeah yeah yeah

Come tonight
Come to the ogre site
Come to ogre battle fight

Ah ah ah ah ah
The ogre men are still inside
The two way mirror mountain
You gotta keep down
Right out of sight
You can't see in but they can see out
Keep a look out
The ogre men are comming out
From the two way mirror mountain
They're running up behind
And they're coming all about
Can't go east 'cause you gotta go south

Ogre men are going home
The great big fight is over
Bugle blow that trumpet cry

Oh oh oh
Ogre Battle lives for ever more
You can come along
You can come along
Come to ogre battle
"Son And Daughter" (May)
I want you
Tried to be your son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun
Didn't you feel surprise to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit

What'll you do for loving
When its only just begun?
I want you to be a woman

Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal people preacher
Will you lead us all the same?
Travelled around the world
And found a brand new word for day
Watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
What'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you to be a woman

Didn't you feel surprise to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit
What'll you do for loving
If it's back from where you came?

"A Kind Of Magic" (Taylor)
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
A kind of magic,
One dream, one soul, one prize,
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One shaft of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
It's a challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will dawn of sanity,
It's a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
This rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be will soon be,
Will soon be gone,
This is a kind of magic,
Tere can only be one,
This life that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be gone,
Magic - it's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
Magic, magic, magic, magic,
It's magic,
It's a kind of magic.
"Bohemian Rhapsody" (Mercury)
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, No escape from reality.
Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me.

Mama just killed a man, Put a gun against his head,
pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
Mama, ooh, Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time.
Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango.
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me.
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo, Galileo figaro
Magnifico. I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go.
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go.
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.
(Let me go.) Will not let you go.
(Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
(Oh mama mia, mama mia.) Mama mia, let me go.
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye.
So you think you can love me and leave me to die.
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me.

Any way the wind blows.
"Hammer To Fall" (May) (Single Mix)
Here we stand and here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight.

CHORUS
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way --
Build your muscles as your body decays.

CHORUS
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the Hammer to Fall.

Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Baby now your struggle's all vain.

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder

CHORUS
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the Hammer to Fall.
"Headlong" (Queen)
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
There's nothin' you can do
No there's nothin' you can do about it
No there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
He used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap `B' movie
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
They start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cause reason's out the window
Better hold on tight - you're rushin' [... etc.]

"One Year Of Love" (Deacon)
Just one year of love
Is better than a lifetime alone,
One sentimental moment in your arms
Is like a shooting star right through my heart,
It's always a rainy day without you,
I'm a prisoner of love inside you -
I'm falling apart all around you - yeah.
My heart cries out to your heart,
I'm lonely but you can save me,
My hand reaches out for your hand,
I'm cold but you light the fire in me,
My lips search for your lips,
I'm hungry for your touch,
There's so much left unspoken
And all I can do is surrender
To the moment just surrender
And no one ever told me that love would hurt so much,
Oooh yes it hurtsm
And pain is so close to pleasure,
And all I can do is surrender to your love,
Just surrender to your love,
Just one year of love,
Is better that a lifetime alone,
One sentimental moment in your arms,
Is like a shooting star right through my heart,
It's always a rainy day without you,
I'm a prisoner of love inside you -
I'm falling apart all around you - yeah.
And all I can do is surrender.
"Radio Ga Ga" (Taylor)
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
Radio.

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds -- invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh -- you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly.

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

You've yet to have your finest hour

"Stone Cold Crazy" (May, Mercury, Taylor, Deacon)
Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning I was dreaming
I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round, gotta clear outa town
I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the Law, gonna break down the door, gonna carry me
away once more
Never, never, never get it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon and I'm playing on
my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore

Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet with
my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I ran outa juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
"The Miracle" (Queen)
Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all,
It's a miracle,
All God's creations great and small, the Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal,
That's a miracle,
Test tube babies being born, mothers, fathers dead and gone,
It's a miracle,
We're having a miracle on earth, mother nature does it all for us,
The wonders of this world go on, the hanging Gardens of Babylon,
Captain Cook and Cain and Able, Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle,
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on earth - an end to war,
It's a miracle we need - the miracle, the miracle we're all waiting for today,
If every leaf on every tree, could tell a story that would be a miracle,
If every child on every street, had clothes to wear and food to eat,
That's a miracle,
If all God's people could be free, to live in perfect harmony,
It's a miracle, we're having a miracle on earth,
Mother nature does it all for us
Open hearts and surgery, Sunday mornings with a cup of tea,
Super powers always fighting,
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling,

The wonders of this world go on,
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle,
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on earth and an end to war,
It's a miracle we need, the miracle, the miracle,
Peace on earth and end to war today,
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends,
repeat ........
"The Show Must Go On" (Queen)
Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on,
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on.
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On - with the show -
I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the -
On with the show �
"These Are The Days Of Our Lives" (Queen)
Sometimes I get to feelin'
I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know?
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were young
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been - just a show.
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true -
When I look and I find I still love you.
You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
Better sit back and go - with the flow
Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find - no change
Those were the days of our lives yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you,
I still love you.
"Tie Your Mother Down" (May) (Single Mix)
Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin' baby
Got my timin' right
Got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight my little
Schoolbabe

Your momma says you don't
And your Daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Lock your Daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight

You're such a dirty louse
Go get outta my house
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Grousin' an' snipin'

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick (that's all right)
Tie your Mother down,
Tie your Mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

Your momma and your Daddy gonna
Plague me til I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a 
Peace lovin' guy
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down. . .etc etc. . .
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight
"Under Pressure" (Queen, Bowie)
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure - that burns a building
down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed
and torn
Why - why - why
Love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're
cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more 
chance
Why can't we give love
Cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
"Who Wants To Live Forever" (May)
There's no time for us,
There's no place for us,
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever.....?
There's no chance for us,
It's all decided for us,
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who dares to love forever,
When love must die.

But touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,
And we can have forever,
And we can love forever,
Forever is our today,
Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever,
Forever is our today,
Who waits forever anyway?

Well I tell you my friend
This might seem like the end
But the continuation is
Yours for the making.........

"Another One Bites The Dust" (Deacon)
Steve walks warily down the street,
with the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
machine guns ready to go
Are you ready, Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along,
without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had,
and kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Chorus

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
you can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
repeating the sound of the beat

"Bohemian Rhapsody" (Mercury)
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide,
No escape from reality
Open your eyes, Look up to the skies and see,
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy,
Because I'm easy come, easy go, Little high, little low,
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me

Mama just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo figaro
Magnifico I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go (Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mama mia, mama mia) Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me

Any way the wind blows

Are you gonna let it all hang out?
Fat bottomed girls you make the rocking world go round

Never knew no good from bad
But I knew love before I left my nursery

She was such a naughty nanny
Heap big woman you made a bad boy out of me

We can do the tango just for two
I can serenade and gently play on your heart strings
Be your Valentino just for you

"Keep Yourself Alive" (May) (Single Mix)
I was told a million times 
Of all the troubles in my way
How I had to keep on trying
Little better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Well they say your folks are telling you
To be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners 
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me ev'rything I need 
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times 
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Still be where I started

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money honey
You'll survive

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money
To keep me satisfied
Do you think you're better ev'ry day
No I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive mm
You take your time and take your money
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money honey
You will survive

Keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied
"Killer Queen" (Mercury)
She keeps Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[CHORUS:]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

[CHORUS]

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild
She's all out to get you

[CHORUS]

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try
"Now I'm Here" (May)
Here I stand
Look around around around
But you won't see me

Now I'm here, Now I'm there, I'm just a

Just a new man
Yes you made me live again

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be - don't worry baby I'm safe and sound

Down in the dungeon just Peaches 'n' me
Don't I love her so

A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With a rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me
Don't I love him so

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around around around
We'll be down in the city justa you 'n' me
Don't I love you so
"Play The Game" (Mercury)
Open up your mind and let me step inside
Rest your weary head and let your heart decide
It's so easy when you know the rules
It's so easy all you have to do
Is fall in love
Play the game,
Everybody play the game of love
When you're feeling down and your resistance is low
Light another cigarette and let yourself go
This is your life
Don't play hard to get
It's a free world
All you have to do is fall in love
Play the game, everybody play the game of love
My game of love has just begun
Love runs from head down to mt toes
My love is pumping through my veins
Driving me insane
Come come come play the game
This is your life - don;t play hard to get
It's a free world all you have to do is fall in love
Play the game
"Save Me" (May)
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you,
How I cried.....
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived a lie
"I'll love you 'til I die"

Save me Save me Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Oh...
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories,
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love?.....
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me Save me Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Oh...
I'm naked and I'm far from home

Each night I cry, I still believe the lie
I'll love you 'til I die
"Seven Seas Of Rhye" (Mercury)
Fear me, you lords and lady preachers,
I descend upon your earth from the skies;
I command your very souls, you unbelievers,
Bring before me what is mine, the seven seas of Rhye

Can you hear me, you peers and privy councillors,
I stand before you naked to the eyes;
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine, at the seven seas of Rhye

Sister, I live and lie for you, Mister, do and I'll die;
You are mine, I posess you, belong to you forever Ah

Storm the master marathon I'll fly through by flash and thunder fire
and I'll survive, I'll survive, I'll survive, then I'll defy
the laws of nature and come out alive
Begone with you, you shod and shady senators
Give out the good leave out the bad evil cries;
I challenge the mighty titan and his troubadours,
And with a smile, I'll take you to the seven seas of Rhye
"Somebody To Love" (Mercury)
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
Each morning I get up I die a little
Can barely stand on my feet
Take a look in the mirror and cry
Lord what you're doing to me
I have spent all my years in believing you
But I just can't get no relief, Lord!
Somebody, somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

I work hard every day of my life
I work till I ache my bones
At the end I take home my hard earned pay all on my own -
I get down on my knees
And I start to pray
Till the tears run down from my eyes
Lord - somebody - somebody
Can anybody find me - somebody to love?

(He works hard)

Everyday - I try and I try and I try -
But everybody wants to put me down
They say I'm goin' crazy
They say I got a lot of water in my brain
Got no common sense
I got nobody left to believe
Yeah - yeah yeah yeah

Oh Lord
Somebody - somebody
Can anybody find me somebody to love?

Got no feel, I got no rhythm
I just keep losing my beat
I'm ok, I'm alright
Ain't gonna face no defeat
I just gotta get out of this prison cell
Someday I'm gonna be free, Lord!

Find me somebody to love
Can anybody find me somebody to love?
"Under Pressure" (Queen And David Bowie)
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure - that burns a building
down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed
and torn
Why - why - why
Love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're
cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more 
chance
Why can't we give love
Cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
"We Are The Champions" (Mercury)
I've paid my dues -
Time after time -
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime -
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face -
But I've come through

We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting - till the end -
We are the champions -
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions - of the world -

I've taken my bows
And my curtain calls -
You brought me fame and fortuen and everything that goes with it -
I thank you all -

But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise -
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race -
And I ain't gonna lose -

We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting - till the end -
We are the champions -
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions - of the world �

whatever this world can give to me
It's you, you're all I see
Ooo, you make me live now honey
Ooo, you make me live

Greatest Hits II
"A Kind Of Magic" (Taylor)
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
A kind of magic,
One dream, one soul, one prize,
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One shaft of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a mind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
It's a challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will dawn of sanity,
It's a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years
Will soon be gone,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
This rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be will soon be,
Will soon be gone,
This is a kind of magic,
Tere can only be one,
This life that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be gone,
Magic - it's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
Magic, magic, magic, magic,
It's magic,
It's a kind of magic.
"Breakthru" (Queen)
When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru . . . Now!

I wake up
Feel just fine,
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cos you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me,
I'm under your thumb, under you're spell, can't you see,
If I could only reach you,
If I could make you smile,
If I could only reach you,
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah.

Breakthru, these barriers of pain,
Breakthru, to the sunshine from the rain,
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow,
I have to make this final breakthru.
Now I

Your smile,
Speaks books to me,
I break up,
With each and every one of your looks at me,
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me,
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me,
I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile,
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Breakthru, breakthru
"Friends Will Be Friends" (Mercury, Deacon)
Another red letter day,
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating,
The other half ran away,
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber,
Got a pain in the chest,
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest.

It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust,
Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.

Now it's a beautiful day,
The postman delivered a letter from your lover,
Only a phone call away,
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number,
As a matter of fact,
You're getting used to life without him in your way.

It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust,
Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.

It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust,
Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end.

Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos right till the end -
Friends will be friends.
"Hammer To Fall" (May) (Single Mix)
Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight.

CHORUS
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way --
Build your muscles as your body decays.

CHORUS
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the Hammer to Fall.

Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Baby now your struggle's all vain.

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder

CHORUS
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the Hammer to Fall.
"Headlong" (Queen)
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
There's nothin' you can do
No there's nothin' you can do about it
No there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
He used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap `B' movie
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
They start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cause reason's out the window
Better hold on tight - you're rushin' [... etc.]
"I Want It All" (Queen) (Single Mix)
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now.

Adventure seeker on an empty street,
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out,
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say,
Gotta find me a future move out of my way,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

Listen all you people, come gather round,
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground,
Just give me what I know is mine,
People do you hear me, just give me the sign,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth,
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

I'm a man with a one track mind,
So much to do in one life time (people do you hear me),
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies,
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all,
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth,
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
etc.
"I Want To Break Free" (Deacon)
I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free.

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love.

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free,
Oh how I want to break free.

But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without,
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see
I've got to break free.

I've got to break free
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free.
"I'm Going Slightly Mad" (Queen)
When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - ooh oh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad
Oh dear!
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not at my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear, I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened uh huh
It finally happened I'm slightly mad - oh dear!
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast its true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear how about you?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened oh yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad!
Just very slightly mad!
And there you have it!
"Innuendo" (Queen)
While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'
Tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on tryin' yeah
Just passing our time
While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'
We'll tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on tryin'
Till the end of time
Till the end of time

Through the sorrow all through our splendour
Don't take offence at my innuendo

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free be free
Surrender your ego - be free, be free to yourself

Oooh, ooh -
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself - destroy our fears - release your mask
Oh yes we'll keep on trying
Hey tread that fine line
Yeah we'll keep on smiling yeah
And whatever will be - will be
We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
"It's A Hard Life" (Mercury)
I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart.

This is a tricky situation --
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone --

You win -- you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah -- I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart.

It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts --
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love --

I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone --

How it hurts -- deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough -- on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
Waiting for love.

Yes it's a hard life
Two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another -- right from the start
When you're in love --
Yes it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way --

It's a long hard fight --
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love
Yes I did it for love -- for love -- oh I did it for love.
"One Vision" (Queen) (Single Mix)

One voice one hope,

I had a dream,
When I was young,
A dream of sweet illusion,
A glimpse of hope and unity,
And visions of one sweet union,
But a cold wind blows,
And a dark rain falls,
And in my heart it shows,
Look what they've done to my dream.

So give me your hands,
Give me your hearts,
I'm ready,
There's only one direction,
One world one nation,
Yeah one vision.

Just gimme gimme gimme
One vision.
"Radio Ga Ga" (Taylor)
I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
Radio.

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds -- invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh -- you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly.

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio.

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!

We watch the shows -- we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years.

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio -- Radio.

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!
"The Invisible Man" (Queen)
I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man,
Incredible how you can,
See right through me,

When you hear a sound,
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace,
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread.

I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you.

Now I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like the CIA
Or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you,

Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello,
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or a girl
No-one knows what I've been through - let my nag unfurl
Sol make my mark from the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,

Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind,
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
Put I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me dear,

I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
Look at me, look at me
"The Miracle" (Queen)
Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all,
It's a miracle,
All God's creations great and small, the Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal,
That's a miracle,
Test tube babies being born, mothers, fathers dead and gone,
It's a miracle,
We're having a miracle on earth, mother nature does it all for us,
The wonders of this world go on, the hanging Gardens of Babylon,
Captain Cook and Cain and Able, Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle,
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on earth - an end to war,
It's a miracle we need - the miracle, the miracle we're all waiting for
today,
If every leaf on every tree, could tell a story that would be a miracle,
If every child on every street, had clothes to wear and food to eat,
That's a miracle,
If all God's people could be free, to live in perfect harmony,
It's a miracle, we're having a miracle on earth,
Mother nature does it all for us
Open hearts and surgery, Sunday mornings with a cup of tea,
Super powers always fighting,
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling,

The wonders of this world go on,
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle,
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on earth and an end to war,
It's a miracle we need, the miracle, the miracle,
Peace on earth and end to war today,
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends,

"The Show Must Go On" (Queen)
Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on,
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on.
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On - with the show -
I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the -
On with the show -
The show must go on...
"Under Pressure" (Queen, Bowie)
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure - that burns a building
down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed
and torn
Why - why - why
Love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're
cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more 
chance
Why can't we give love
Cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
"Who Wants To Live Forever" (May)
There's no time for us,
There's no place for us,
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever.....?
There's no chance for us,
It's all decided for us,
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us.

Who wants to live forever,
Who dares to love forever,
When love must die.

But touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,
And we can have forever,
And we can love forever,
Forever is our today,
Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever,
Forever is our today,
Who waits forever anyway?

This town honey is a dead town
Living in this town honey is a showdown

You're taking all the sunshine away
Making out like you're the mainline - I knew that
Cos you're a cool cat
Tapping on the toe with a new hat
Just cruising - driving along like the swing king
Feeling the beat of my heart

Coming on strong with all the chit-chat

Hanging out and stealing all the limelight
Messing with the beat of my heart
Messing with the beat of my heart
You used to be a mean kid
Making such a deal of life
You were wishing and hoping wand waiting to
really hit the big time
But did it happen, happen, no
You're speeding too fast

Slow down

And you really get inside the groove

"Las Palabras De Amor (The Words Of Love)" (May)
Don't touch me now
Don't hold me now
Don't break the spell darling, now you are
near
Look in my eyes
And speak to me
The special promises I want to hear
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Love me slow and gently
One foolish world, so many souls
Senselessly hurled through the never ending
cold
And all for fear, and all for greed
Speak any tongue but for God's sake we
need
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Let me know, this night and evermore
This room is bare
This night is cold
We're apart and I'm growing old
But while we live, we'll meet again
So then my love we may whisper once more
It's you I adore
Las palabras de amor
Let me hear the words of love
Despacito mi amor
Touch me now
Las palabras de amor
Let us share the words of love
For evermore
For evermore
"Life Is Real (Song For Lennon)" (Mercury)
Guilt stains on my pillow
Blood on ny terraces
Torsos in my closet
Shadows from my past live is real
Life is real, life is real, so real
Sleeping is my leisure
Waking up in a minefield
Dream is just a pleasure dome
Love is a roulette wheel - life is real
Life is real, life is real, oh yeah
Success is my breathing space
I brought it on myself
I will price it
I will cash it
I can take it or leave it
Loneliness is my hiding place
Breastfeeding myself
What more can I say
I have swallowed the bitter pill
I can taste it, I can taste it
Life is real, life is real, life is real
Music will be my mistres
Loving like a whore
Lennon is a genius
Living in every pore
Life is real, life is real, life is real, so real
Life is cruel
Life is a bitch
Life is real - so real
"Put Out The Fire" (May)
They called him a hero
In the land of the free
But he wouldn't shake my hand boy
He disappointed me
So I got my handgun
And I blew him away
That critter was a bad guy
I had to make him pay
You might fear for my reason
I don't care what they say
Look out baby it's the season
For the mad masquerade
Put out the fire
You need a bullet like a hole in the head
Put out the fire
Don't believe what your grandaddy said
She was my lover
It was a shame that she died
But the constitution's right on my side
Cos I caught my lover in my neighbour's bed
I got retribution, filled 'em full of lead
I've been told it's the fashion
To let me on the streets again
It's nothing but a crime of passion
And I'm not to blame
Put out the fir
And let yor sons and your daughters
Sleep sound in their beds
You know a gun never killed nobody
You can ask anyone
People get shot by people
People with guns
Put out the fire
You ned a gun like a hole in the head
Out out the fire
Just tell me that old fashioned gun law!!!!!!
is dead
"Staying Power" (Mercury)
(Horns arranged by Arif Mardin)

Let me show it to you
See what I got

Tell me what you feel

You know I got what it takes
And I can take a lot
Did you hear the last call baby
You and me got staying power
Staying power I got it I got it

We'll work it, work it , work it
You and I can play ball baby
You and me got staying power
I wonder when we're gonna make it
I wondows when we're gonna shake it
I've got fire down below
I'm just a regular dynamo
Want some smooth company
Don't lose control just hang on out with me
Got to get to know each other
But we got plenty of time
Did you hear the last call baby
You and me got staying power
You and me we got staying power
Power
I wonder where we're gonna stick it
I wonder when we're gonna trick it
Blow baby blow

Let's just trash trash trash
Did you hear the last call baby
You and me got staying power
You and me we got staying power
Staying power... got'cha
"Under Pressure" (Queen And David Bowie)
Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure - that burns a building
down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed
and torn
Why - why - why
Love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're
cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more 
chance
Why can't we give love
Cause love's such an old fashioned word
and love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
Innuendo
"All God's People" (Queen, Mike Moran)
So all you people give freely
Make welcome inside your homes
Thank God you people give freely
Don't turn your back on the lesson of the Lord
All prime ministers and majesty around the world
Open your eyes look, touch and feel
Rule with your heart, live with your conscience
Love, love,
Love, love and be free
We're all God's people
Gotta face up

Gotta stand tall and be strong
Gotta face up

Then I, then I, then I went into a dream
Rule with your heart and live with your conscience
We're all God's people give freely
Make welcome inside your homes
Let us be thankful, he's so incredible
We're all God's people

"Bijou" (Queen)
You and me are destined
You'll agree
To spend the rest of our lives with each other
The rest of our days like two lovers
For ever - yeah - for ever
My bijou...
"Delilah" (Queen)
Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're irresistible
You make me smile when I'm just about to cry
You bring me hope, you make me laugh - you like it
You get away with murder, so innocent
But when you throw a moody you're all claws and you bite -
That's alright!
Delilah, Delilah, oh my, oh my, oh my - you're unpredictable
You make me so very happy
When you cuddle up and go to sleep beside me
And then you make me slightly mad
When you pee all over my Chippendale Suite
Delilah, Delilah,
Hey - Hey - Hey,
You take over my house and home
You even try to answer my telephone
Delilah, you're the apple of my eyes
Meeow, Meeow, Meeow,
Delilah - I love you
Oh you make me so very happy - you give me kisses
And I go out of my mind ooh,
Meeow, Meeow, Meeow, Meeow,
You're irresistible - I love you Delilah
Delilah - I love you
Oooh - I love your kisses
Oooh - I love your kisses...
"Don't Try So Hard" (Queen)
If you're searching out for something -
Don't try so hard
If you're feeling kinda nothing -
Don't try so hard
When your problems seem like mountains
You feel the need to find some answers
You can leave them for another day
Don't try so hard
But if you fall and take a tumble -
It won't be far
If you fail you mustn't grumble -
Thank your lucky stars
Just savour every mouthful
And treasure every moment
When the storms are raging round you
Stay right where you are
Don't try so hard
Oooh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools they make these rules
Don't try so hard
One day you'll be a sergeant major
Oh you'll be so proud
Screaming out your bloody orders
Hey but not too loud
Polish all your shiny buttons
Dressed as lamb instead of mutton
But you never had to try
To stand out from the crowd
Oh what a beautiful world
Is this the life for me
Oh what a beautiful world
It's the simple life for me
Oh don't try so hard
Oh don't take it all to heart
It's only fools - they make these rules
Don't try so hard
Don't try so hard
"Headlong" (Queen)
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
There's nothin' you can do
No there's nothin' you can do about it
No there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
And you're rushing headlong you've got a new goal
And you're rushing headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping no there's nothin'
You can do about it
He used to be a man with a stick in his hand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
She used to be a woman with a hot dog stand
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Now you've got soup in the laundry bag
Now you've got strings, you're gonna lose your rag
You're gettin' in a fight
Then it ain't so groovy when you're screaming in the night
Let me out of this cheap `B' movie
Headlong down the highway and you're rushing
Headlong out of control
And you think you're so strong
But there ain't no stopping and you can't stop rockin'
And there's nothin' you can, nothin' you can
Nothin' you can do about it
When a red hot man meets a white hot lady
Hoop diddy diddy - Hoop diddy do
Soon the fire starts a raging gets 'em more than half crazy
They start freaking everyway you turn
You can't start walking cause your feet got burned
It ain't no time to figure wrong from right
Cause reason's out the window
Better hold on tight - you're rushin'... etc.
"I Can't Live With You" (Queen)
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you -
I can't let you stay
But I can't live if you go away
I don't know just how it goes
All I know is I can't live with you
I'm having a hard time
I'm walking a fine line
Between hope and despair
You may think that I don't care -
But I travelled a long road to
Get a hold of my sorrow
I tried to catch a dream
But nothing's what it seems
Love is saying baby it's all right
When deep inside you're really petrified
Lover turns to hater
On this escalator
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I can't breathe - if you stay
But I can't bear you to go away
I don't know what time it is
All I know is I can't live with you
We're stuck in a bad polace
We're trapped in a rat race
And we can't escape
Maybe there's been some mistake
We're trying to make a high score
We're walking through a closed door
And nobody's winning -
We're just sinning against ourselves
Hold on baby tell me it's all right
Anger's breaking from the hurt inside
Passions screaming hotter
Doin' what we gotta do - yeah
I can't live with you, I can't live with you
I can't live, I can't live
I can't, I can't live with you
But baby I'll never ever leave you
I can't live with you
But I can't live without you -
Cause I'm in love with you
And everything about you
I can't live with you
No I just can't live, I just can't live,
I can't live with you,
And I can't live without you
Through the madness, through the tears
We've still got each other
For a million years
"I'm Going Slightly Mad" (Queen)
When the outside temperature rises
And the meaning is oh so clear
One thousand and one yellow daffodils
Begin to dance in front of you - oh dear
Are they trying to tell you something?
You're missing that one final screw
You're simply not in the pink my dear
To be honest you haven't got a clue
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened - happened
It finally happened - ooh oh
It finally happened - I'm slightly mad
Oh dear!
I'm one card short of a full deck
I'm not quite the shilling
One wave short of a shipwreck
I'm not at my usual top billing
I'm coming down with a fever
I'm really out to sea
This kettle is boiling over
I think I'm a banana tree
Oh dear, I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened, happened
It finally happened uh huh
It finally happened I'm slightly mad - oh dear!
I'm knitting with only one needle
Unravelling fast its true
I'm driving only three wheels these days
But my dear how about you?
I'm going slightly mad
I'm going slightly mad
It finally happened
It finally happened oh yes
It finally happened
I'm slightly mad!
Just very slightly mad!
And there you have it!
"Innuendo" (Queen)
While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'
Tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on tryin' yeah
Just passing our time
While we live according to race, colour or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on
Oh yes we'll keep on tryin'
We'll tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on tryin'
Till the end of time
Till the end of time

Through the sorrow all through our splendour
Don't take offence at my innuendo

You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free be free
Surrender your ego - be free, be free to yourself

Oooh, ooh -
If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself - destroy our fears - release your mask
Oh yes we'll keep on trying
Hey tread that fine line
Yeah we'll keep on smiling yeah
And whatever will be - will be
We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
"Ride The Wild Wind" (Queen)

"The Hitman" (Queen)

Ain't no escaping
Don't run and hide
There goes the neighbourhood
I'm gonna kill for your love
Hitman

Yeah - yeah
You're gonna make my day
Gonna blow you away
Now the fun begins
Hitman
Are you ready for the sting
Gonna waste that thing
Hitman is king
"The Show Must Go On" (Queen)
Empty spaces - what are we living for
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...
Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore
The show must go on,
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on.
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for?
I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free
The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairytales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly - my friends
The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On - with the show -
I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the -
On with the show -
The show must go on...
"These Are The Days Of Our Lives" (Queen)
Sometimes I get to feelin'
I was back in the old days - long ago
When we were kids, when we were young
Things seemed so perfect - you know?
The days were endless, we were crazy - we were young
The sun was always shinin' - we just lived for fun
Sometimes it seems like lately - I just don't know
The rest of my life's been - just a show.
Those were the days of our lives
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing is true -
When I look and I find I still love you.
You can't turn back the clock, you can't turn back the tide
Ain't that a shame?
I'd like to go back one time on a roller coaster ride
When life was just a game
No use sitting and thinkin' on what you did
When you can lay back and enjoy it through your kids
Sometimes it seems like lately I just don't know
Better sit back and go - with the flow
Cos these are the days of our lives
They've flown in the swiftness of time
These days are all gone now but some things remain
When I look and I find - no change
Those were the days of our lives yeah
The bad things in life were so few
Those days are all gone now but one thing's still true
When I look and I find, I still love you,
I still love you.

Oh it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream of you

Oh take me take me take me
To the dreamer's ball
I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me take me
Promise
'Till it's morning
It's all been true

Oh take me take me take me
I'm your play thing now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me remember I'll be dreaming of my baby
At the dreamer's ball

Take me hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball
I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball

Keep your chin up when you're feeling lonely

"In Only Seven Days" (Deacon)
Monday the start of my holiday
Freedom for just one week
Feels good to get away ooh

Tuesday I saw here down on the beach
I stood and watched a while
And she looked and smiled at me

Wednesday I didn't see her
I hoped that she'd be back tomorrow
And then on Thursday my luck had changed
She stood there all alone
I went and asked her name
I never thought that this could happen to me
In only seven days
It would take a hundred or more
For memories to fade

I wish Friday could last forever
I held her close to me
I couldn't bear to leave her there

Saturday just twenty four hours
Oh no I'm going back home on Sunday
Ooh so sad alone
"Jealousy" (Mercury)
Oh how wrong can you be?
Oh to fall in love was my very first mistake
How was I to know I was far too much in love to see?
Oh jealousy look at me now
Jealousy you got me somehow
You gave me no warning
Took me by surprise
Jealousy you led me on
You couldn't lose you couldn't fail
You had suspicion on my trail

How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy

Oh how strong can you be
With matters of the heart?
Life is much too short 
To while away with tears
If only you could see just what you do to me
Oh jealousy you tripped me up
Jealousy you brought me down
You bring me sorrow you cause me pain
Jealousy when will you let go?
Gotta hold of my possessive mind
Turned me into a jealous kind

How how how all my jealousy
I wasn't man enough to let you hurt my pride
Now I'm only left with my own jealousy
But now it matters not if I should live or die
'Cause I'm only left with my own jealousy
"Leaving Home Ain't Easy" (May)
I take a step outside
And I breathe the air
And I slam the door
And I'm on my way
I won't lay no blame
I won't call you names
'Cause I've made my break
And I won't look back
I've turned my back
On those endless games

I'm all through with ties
I'm all tired of tears
I'm a happy man
Don't it look that way?
Shaking dust from my shoes
There's a road ahead
And there's no way back home
Ohh but I have
Leaving home ain't easy
Oh I never thought it would be easy
Leaving on your own
Oh is the main thing calling me back?
Leaving home ain't easy
On the one your leaving home

Stay my love my love please stay
Stray my love what's wrong my love?
What's right my love?
Ohh leaving home ain't easy
I thought how could I think of leaving
Leaving on your own
Still trying to persuade me that
Leaving home ain't necessary
Leave the only way
Leaving home ain't easy
But may be the only way

If you're feeling tired and lonely
Uninspired and lonely
If you're thinking how the days seem long
All you're given
Is what you've been given a thousand times before
Just more more

"A Kind Of Magic" (Taylor)
It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
A kind of magic,
One dream, one soul, one prize,
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One flash of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
It's a challenging the doors of time,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will dawn of sanity,
Is this a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be gone,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
It's a kind of magic,
A little bit of magic,
Give it to me,
This rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be will soon be,

"Another One Bites The Dust" (Deacon)Steve walks warily down the street,
with the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
machine guns ready to go
Are you ready, Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along,
without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had,
and kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Chorus

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Yeah
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
And bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
You can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
repeating the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust
Dust
"Bohemian Rhapsody" (Mercury)Mama just killed a man, put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me
(Galileo) Galileo (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo figaro
Magnifico I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you go (Let me go) Ah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh mama mia, mama mia) Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters, anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
(Nothing really matters to me)
Nothing really matters to me

Any way the wind blows

Crazy little thing called love

There goes my baby
She knows how to Rock n' roll
She drives me crazy
She gives me hot and cold fever
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat

Take a back seat, hitch-hike
And take a long ride on my motor bike

"Friends Will Be Friends" (Mercury, Deacon)Another red letter day,
So the pound has dropped and the children are creating,
The other half ran away,
Taking all the cash and leaving you with the lumber,
Got a pain in the chest,
Doctors on strike what you need is a rest

It's not easy love, but you've got friends you can trust,
Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end

Now it's a beautiful day,
The postman delivered a letter from your lover,
Only a phone call away,
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number,
As a matter of fact,
You're getting used to life without him in your way

It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust,
Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends (right till the end)
"Hammer To Fall" (May)Here we stand or here we fall
History don't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

CHORUS
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way --
Build your muscles as your body decays

CHORUS
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
Then it's time for the Hammer to Fall

Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
Oh no, oh no
Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Oh no
Baby now your struggle's all vain

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder

CHORUS
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the Hammer to hammer to fall
Waiting for the Hammer to hammer to hammer to fall
"I Want To Break Free" (Deacon)(I want to break free)
(I want to break free)
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've want to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to break free,
Oh how I want to break free

But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without,
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see
God knows, gods know, gods know
I've want to break free
"In The Lap Of The Gods" (Mercury)It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky - But I gotta a chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods
I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
It's in the lap of the Gods
"Is This The World We Created?" (Mercury, May)Just look of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

Is this the world we created, we made it on our own
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law
So it seems in the end
Is this what we are living for today
World that we created

You know that every day a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by

Is this the world we created, we made it on our own
Is this the world we devasted, right to the bone
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created
"Love Of My Life" (Mercury)Love of my life,

Love of my life don't leave me,
You've stolen my love you now desert me,

Love of my life can't you see,
Bring it back bring it back,
Don't take it away from me,
Because you don't know what it means to me

You will remember when this is blown over,
And everything's all by the way,
When I grow older,
I will be there at your side,
To remind how I still love you
I still love you
I still love you

Hurry back hurry back,
Don't take it away from me,
Because you don't know what it means to me

Love of my life,
Love of my life

But you won't see me

Now I'm here, Now I'm there, I'm just a

Down in the dungeon just Peaches 'n' me
Don't I love you so
Yes you make me live again

A thin moon beam in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With a rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me

Whatever comes of you and me

Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around around around around round
Down in the city justa you 'n' me
You me, only you and me

My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
Radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds -- invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh -- you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour

Got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight my little
Schoolbabe

Your momma says you don't
And your Daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Lock your Daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight

You're such a dirty louse
Go get outta my house
That's all I ever get from you
Family ties, in fact I never heard
A single little civil word from you guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Shouting and fighting goin' on

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick (that's all right)
Tie your Mother down,
Tie your Mother down
She you ain't no friend of mine

Your momma and your Daddy gonna
Plague me til I die
They don't understand I'm just a
Peace lovin' guy
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight
All your love tonight
All your love tonight
All your love tonight
All your love tonight
Give it to me
"Under Pressure" (Queen, Bowie)Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure - that burns a building
down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
She been around
Kicked my brains round the floor
These are the days it rains but it never pours
People on streets
People on streets
It's the terror of knowing
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - high higher
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed
and torn
Why - Ooooh
Insanity laughs under pressure we're
cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more 
chance
Why can't we give love
Give love give love give love give love
Give love give love give love
Love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves

This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure

"Who Wants To Live Forever" (May)There's no time for us,
There's no place for us,
What is this thing that builds our dreams, yet slips away from us

Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever?
There's no chance for us,
It's all decided for us,
This world has only one sweet moment set aside for us

Who wants to live forever,
Who dares to love forever,
Who dare who dare,
Who wants to live forever,
When love must die

So touch my tears with your lips,
Touch my world with your fingertips,
And we can have forever,
And we can have forever,
Forever is our today,
Who wants to live forever,
Who wants to live forever,
Forever is our today,
Who waits forever anyway?

"'39" (May)In the year of '39 assembled here the Volunteers
In the days when lands were few
Here the ship sailed out into the blue and misty morn
The sweetest sight ever seen.

And the night followed dau
And the story tellers day
That the score brave souls inside
For many a lonely day sailed across the milky seas
Ne'er looked back, never feared, never cried.

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
Write your letters in the sand
For the day I take your hand
In the land that our grandchildren knew.

In the year of '39 came a ship in from the blue
The Volunteers came home that day
And they bring good news of a world so newly born
Though their hearts so heavily weigh
And the earth is old and grey, to a new home we'll away
But my love this cannot be

For so many years have gone and I'm older but a year
Your mother's eyes in your eyes cry to me.
Write your letters in the sand

Don't you hear my call though you're many years away
Don't you hear me calling you
All your in the sand cannot heal me like your hand

All my life
Still ahead
Pity Me.

"Bohemian Rhapsody" (Mercury)Mama just killed a man, Put a gun against his head,
pulled my trigger, now he's dead.
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away.
Mama, ooh, Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters.

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time.
Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth.
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all.

I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango.
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very fright'ning me.
(Galileo.) Galileo. (Galileo.) Galileo, Galileo figaro
Magnifico. I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me.
He's just a poor boy from a poor family,
Spare him his life from this monstrosity.
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go.
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go.
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.
(Let him go!) Bismillah! We will not let you go.
(Let me go.) Will not let you go.
(Let me go.) Will not let you go. (Let me go.) Ah.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
(Oh mama mia, mama mia.) Mama mia, let me go.
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me.

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye.
So you think you can love me and leave me to die.
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here.

Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me.

Any way the wind blows.
"Brighton Rock" (May)Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"

"Jenny will you stay - tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what do you say"
"Oh no I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"

[CHORUS:]

O Rock of Ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
O Lady Moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"
"Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologise
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays . . ."
"Death On Two Legs" (Mercury)You suck my blood like a leech
You break the law and you breach
Screw my brain till it hurts
You've taken all my money-you still want more,

Misguided old mule
With your pgheaded rules
With your narrow-minded cronies who are fools of the first division-

Death on two legs-
You're tearing me apart,
Death on two legs
You never had a heard of your own-

Kill joy, Bad guy,
Big talking, Small fry
You're just an old barrow-boy
Have you found a new toy to replace me,
Can you face me-

But now you can kiss my ass goodbye

Feel good, are you satisfied

Do you feel like suicide (I think you should)
Is your conscience all right
Does it plague you at night,
Do you feel good-Feel good!
"Don't Stop Me Now" (Mercury)Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time

And I'm floating around in ecstasy
So don't stop me now don't stop me

On a collision course

Like an atom bomb about to

"Dreamer's Ball" (May)Oh I used to be your baby
Used to be your pride and joy
You used to take me dancing
Just like any other boy
But now you've found another partner
You've left me like a broken toy

Oh it's someone else you're taking
Someone else you're playing to
Honey though I'm aching
Know just what I have to do
If I can't have you when I'm waking
I'll go to sleep and dream of you

Oh take me take me take me
To the dreamer's ball
I'll be right on time and I'll dress so fine
You're gonna love me when you see me
I won't have to worry
Take me take me
Promise
'Not to wake me
It's all been true

Oh take me take me take me
I'm your play thing now
You make my life worthwhile
With the slightest smile
Or destroy me with a barely perceptible whisper
Gently take me remember I'll be dreaming of my baby
At the dreamer's ball

Take me hold me
Remember what you told me
You'd meet me at the dreamer's ball
I'll meet you at the dreamer's ball
"Get Down, Make Love" (Mercury)Get down make love

"I'm In Love With My Car" (Taylor)The machine of a dream, such a clean machine,
With the pistons a pumpin', and the hubcaps all gleam.
When I'm holding your wheel,
All I hear is your gear,
When my hand's on your grease gun,
Oh it's like a disease son,
I'm in love with my car, gotta feel for my automobile,
Get a grip on my boy racer rollbar,
Such a thrill when your radials squeal.

Told my girl I just had to forget her,
Rather buy me a new cartburettor,
So she made tracks sayin' ths is the end now,
Cars don't talk back they're just four wheeled friends now
"Keep Yourself Alive" (May)Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive

I was told a million times 
Of all the troubles in my way
How I had to keep on trying
Little better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Well they say your folks are telling you
To be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners 

Brought to me on silver trays
Give me ev'rything I need 
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times 
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Still be where I started

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep you
rself alive
Do you think you're better ev'ry day
No I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive mm
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
To keep me satisfied
Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
All you people keep yourself alive
Take you all your time and money honey
You will survive

Keep you satisfied
Keep you satisfied
"Killer Queen" (Mercury)She keeps Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says
Just like
Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

[CHORUS:]
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

[CHORUS]
"Let Me Entertain You" (Mercury)Let me welcome you ladies and gentlemen
I would like to say hello
Are you ready for some entertainment?
Are you ready for a show?
Gonna rock gonna roll you
Get you dancing in the aisles
Jazz and a razzmatazz you
With a little bit of style
C'mon let me entertain you
Let me entertain you let me entertain you

I've come here to sell you my body
I can show you some good merchandise
I'll pull you and pill you
I'll crueladeville you 
And to thrill you I'll use any device

We'll give you crazy performance
We'll give you grounds for divorce
We'll give you piece de resistance
And a tour de force of course

We found the right location
Got a lot of pretty lights
The sound and amplification listen
Hey if you need a fix if you want a high
Stickells see to that
With Elektra and EMI
We'll show you where it's at
So c'mon
Let me entertain you let me entertain you 
Let me entertain you

Just take a look at the menu
We give you rock a la carte
We'll breakfast at Tiffany's
We'll sing to you in Japanese
We're only here to entertain you

If you wanna see some action
You get nothing but the best
The S and M attraction
We've got the pleasure chest
Chicago and New Orleans
We get you on the line
If you dig the New York scene
We'll have a son of a bitch of a time
C'mon
Let me entertain you let me entertain you
Let me entertain you tonight
"Love Of My Life" (Mercury)Love of my life, you hurt me,
You broken my heart, now you leave me.

Love of my life can't you see,
Bring it back bring it back,
Don't take it away from me,
Because you don't know what it means to me.

Love of my life don't leave me,
You've stolen my love now desert me,

Love of my life can't you see,
Bring it back bring it back,
Don't take it away from me,
Because you don't know what it means to me.

You will remember when this is blown over,
And everything's all by the way,
When I grow older,
I will be there by your side,
To remind how I still love you
I still love you.

Hurry back hurry back,
Don't take it away from me,
Because you don't know what it means to me.

Love of my life,
Love of my life.
"Now I'm Here" (May)Here I stand
Look around around around
But you won't see me

Now I'm here, Now I'm there, I'm just a . . .

Just a new man
Yes you made me live again

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be - don't worry baby I'm safe and sound

Down in the dungeon just Peaches 'n' me
Don't I love her so

A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With a rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me
Don't I love him so

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around around around
We'll be down in the city justa you 'n' me
Don't I love you so
"Sheer Heart Attack" (Taylor)Well you're just 17 and all you wanna do is disappear
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears
The way that you touch don't feel nothin'
Hey hey hey hey, it was the DNA
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel

Sheer heart attack
Sheer heart attack
Real cardiac

I feel so in-articulate

Gotta feelin', gotta feelin', gotta feelin', like I'm paralysed
It ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no, it ain't no surprise
Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes
Hey hey hey hey, it was the DNA
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel

Sheer heart attack

"Spread Your Wings" (Deacon)Sammy was low
Just watching the show
Over and over again
Knew it was time
He'd made up his mind
To leave his dead life behind
His boss said to him
"Boy you'd better begin
To get those crazy notions right out of your head
Sammy who do you think that you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cos you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon
Wishing he was miles and miles away 
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay

Since he was small
Had no luck at all
Nothing came easy to him
Now it was time
He'd made up his mind
"This could be my last chance"
His boss said to him, "Now listen boy!
You're always dreaming
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are?
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar"

So honey

Spread your wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Spread your little wings and fly away
Fly away, far away
Pull yourself together
'Cos you know you should do better
That's because you're a free man
"Tie Your Mother Down" (May)Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin' baby
Got your timin' right
Got your act all tight
It's gotta be tonight my little
Schoolbabe

Your momma says you don't
And your Daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Lock your Daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight

You're such a dirty louse
Go get outta my house
That's all I ever get from your
Family ties, in fact I don't think I ever heard
A single little civil word from those guys
But you know I don't give a light
I'm gonna make out all right
I've got a sweetheart hand
To put a stop to all that
Grousin' an' snipin'

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Take your little brother swimmin'
With a brick (that's all right)
Tie your Mother down,
Tie your Mother down
Or you ain't no friend of mine

Your momma and your Daddy gonna
Plague me til I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a 
Peace lovin' guy
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down. . .etc etc. . .

You're my best friend

Ooo, you make me live

I've been wandering round
But I still come back to you
In rain or shine
You've stood by me girl
I'm happy, happy at home
You're my best friend.

Ooo, you make me live.

I'm happy, happy at home
You're my best friend
You're my best friend
Ooo, you make me live
You, you're my best friend.
Live Magic
"A Kind Of Magic" (Taylor)It's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
One dream, one soul, one prize,
One goal, one golden glance of what should be,
It's a kind of magic,
One shaft of light that shows the way,
No mortal man can win this day,
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
It's challenging the doors of time,
The waiting seems eternity,
The day will dawn of sanity,
Is this a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
There can be only one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be gone,
This flame that burns inside of me,
I'm hearing secret harmonies
It's a kind of magic,
The bell that rings inside your mind,
Is challenging the doors of time,
This rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be will soon be,
Will soon be gone,
This is a kind of magic,
Tere can only be one,
This rage that lasts a thousand years,
Will soon be gone,
Magic - it's a kind of magic,
It's a kind of magic,
Magic, magic, magic, magic,
It's magic,
It's a kind of magic
"Another One Bites The Dust" (Deacon)Steve walks warily down the street,
with the brim pulled way down low
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet,
machine guns ready to go
Are you ready, Are you ready for this
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
And another one gone, and another one gone
Another one bites the dust
Hey, I'm gonna get you too
Another one bites the dust

How do you think I'm going to get along,
without you, when you're gone
You took me for everything that I had,
and kicked me out on my own

Are you happy, Are you satisfied
How long can you stand the heat
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
To the sound of the beat

Chorus

Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
Another one bites the dust
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man
and bring him to the ground
You can beat him
You can cheat him
you can treat him bad and leave him
When he's down
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you
I'm standing on my own two feet
Out of the doorway the bullets rip
Repeating the sound of the beat
"Bohemian Rhapsody" (Mercury)Mama just killed a man, Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun,
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, Didn't mean to make you cry,
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow,
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters

Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, ev'rybody, I've got to go,
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die,
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby,
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here

Nothing really matters, Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters,
Nothing really matters to me

Any way the wind blows
"Friends Will Be Friends" (Mercury, Deacon)Now it's a beautiful day,
The postman delivered a letter from your lover,
Only a phone call away,
You tried to track him down but somebody stole his number,
As a matter of fact,
You're getting used to life without him in your way

It's so easy now, cos you got friends you can trust,
Friends will be friends,
When you're in need of love they give you care and attention,
Friends will be friends,
When you're through with life and all hope is lost,
Hold out your hand cos friends will be friends right till the end
"Hammer To Fall" (May)Here we stand or here we fall
History don't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight

CHORUS
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall

Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way --
Build your muscles as your body decays

CHORUS
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the Hammer to Fall

Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
Lock your door 'cause rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Baby now your struggle's all vain

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the mushroom cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder

CHORUS
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the Hammer to Fall
"I Want To Break Free" (Deacon)I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time
And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free,
Oh how I want to break free

But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without,
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see
I've got to break free
"Is This The World We Created?" (Mercury, May)Just look of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need

Is this the world we created, we made it on our own
Is this the world we devasted, right to the bone
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created
"One Vision" (Queen)One man one goal one mission,
One heart one soul just one solution,
One flash of light yeah one god one vision

One flesh one bone,
One true religion,
One voice one hope,
Wowowowo gimme one vision

No wrong no right,
I'm gonna tell you there's no black and no white,
No blood no stain,
All we need is one world wide vision

One flesh one bone,
One true religion,
One voice one hope,
One real decision,
Wowowowo gimme one vision

I had a dream,
When I was young,
A dream of sweet illusion,
A glimpse of hope and unity,
And visions of one sweet union,
But a cold wind blows,
And a dark rain falls,
And in my heart it shows,
Look what they've done to my dream

So give me your hands,
Give me your hearts,
I'm ready,
There's only one direction,
One world one nation,
Yeah one vision

No hate no fight,
Just excitation,
All through the night,
It's a celebration wowowowo yeah

One flesh one bone,
one true religion,
One voice one hope,
One real decision

Gimme one night,
Gimme one hope,
One man one man,
One bar one night,
One day hey hey,
Just gimme gimme gimme
One vision
"Radio Ga Ga" (Taylor)I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
Radio

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds -- invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh -- you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!

We watch the shows -- we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio -- Radio

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!
"Seven Seas Of Rhye" (Mercury)Fear me you lords and lady preachers
I descend upon your earth from the skies
I command your very souls you unbelievers
Bring before me what is mine
The seven seas of Rhye

Can you hear me you peers and privy councillors
I stand before you naked to the eyes
I will destroy any man who dares abuse my trust
I swear that you'll be mine
At the seven seas of Rhye

Sister I live and lie for you
Mister do and I'll die
You are mine I possess you
Belong [or Make love] to you forever
"Tie Your Mother Down" (May)Get your party gown
Get your pigtail down
Get your heart beatin' baby
Got my timin' right
Got my act all tight
It's gotta be tonight my little
Schoolbabe

Your momma says you don't
And your Daddy says you won't
And I'm boilin' up inside
Ain't no way I'm gonna lose out this time

Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Lock your Daddy out of doors
I don't need him nosing around
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down
Give me all your love tonight

Your momma and your Daddy gonna
Plague me til I die
Why can't they understand I'm just a 
Peace lovin' guy
Tie your Mother down
Tie your Mother down etc etc
"Under Pressure" (Queen And David Bowie)Pressure pushing down on me
Pressing down on you no man ask for
Under pressure - that burns a building
down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Pressure on people - people on streets
It's the terror of knowing 
What this world is about
Watching some good friends
Screaming let me out
Pray tomorrow - gets me higher
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed
and torn
Why - why - why
Love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're
cracking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance
Why can't we give love that one more 
chance
Why can't we give love
Cause love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves
Under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure
"We Are The Champions" (Mercury)I've paid my dues -
Time after time -
I've done my sentence
But committed no crime -
And bad mistakes
I've made a few
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face -
But I've come through

We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting - till the end -
We are the champions -
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions - of the world -

But it's been no bed of roses
No pleasure cruise -
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race -
And I ain't gonna lose -

We are the champions - my friends
And we'll keep on fighting - till the end -
We are the champions -
We are the champions
No time for losers
'Cause we are the champions - of the world �

Made In Heaven
"Heaven For Everyone" (Roger Taylor)This could be heaven
This could be heaven
This could be heaven for everyone

In these days of cool reflection
You come to me and everything seems alright
In these days of cold affections
You sit by me - and everything's fine

This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This could be heaven for everyone
This world could be free, this world could be one

In this world of cool deception
Just smile can smooth my ride
These troubled days of cruel rejection, hmm
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind

Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone
This world could be fed, this world could be fun
This should be love for everyone, yeah
This world should be free, this world could be one
We should bring love to our daughters and sons
Love, love, love, this could be heaven for everyone

You know that
This could be heaven for everyone
This could be heaven for everyone

Listen - what people do to other souls
They take their lives - destroy their goals
Their basic pride and dignity
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity
When this should be heaven for everyone	
"I Was Born To Love You" (Freddie Mercury)I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day...

(chorus:)
I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
You're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity
I'd kill for your love

So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And my dream's come true
It's so hard to believe
This is happening to me
An amazing feeling
Coming through -

(chorus)

I wanna love you
I love every little thing about you
I wanna love you, love you, love you
Born - to love you
Born - to love you
Yes I was born to love you
Born - to love you
Born - to love you
Every single day - of my life

An amazing feeling
Comin' through

(chorus)

Yes I was born to love you
Every single day of my life

Go, I love you babe
Yes, I was born to love you
I wanna love you, love you, love you
I wanna love you
I get so lonely, lonely, lonely
Yeah, I wan't to love you
Yeah, give it to me
"It's A Beautiful Day" (Queen)It's a beautiful day
The sun is shining
I feel good
And no-one's gonna stop me now, oh yeah

It's a beautiful day
I feel good, I feel right
And no-one, no-one's gonna stop me now
Mama

Sometimes I feel so sad, so sad, so bad
But no-one's gonna stop me now, no-one
It's hopeless - so hopeless to even try
"Let Me Live" (Queen)Why don't you take another little piece of my heart
Why don't you take it and break it
And tear it all apart
All I do is give
All you do is take
Baby why don't you give me
A brand new start

So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Let me live, oh baby
And make a brand new start

Why don't you take another little piece of my soul
Why don't you shape it and shake it
'til you're really in control
All you do is take
And all I do is give
All that I'm askin'
Is a chance to live

(So let me live) - so let me live
(Leave me alone) - let me live, let me live
Why don't you let me make a brand new start

And it's a long hard struggle
But you can always depend on me
And if you're ever in trouble - hey
You know where I will be

Why don't you take another little piece of my life
Why don't you twist it, and turn it
And cut it like a knife
All you do is live
All I do is die
Why can't we just be friends
Stop livin' a lie

So let me live (so let me live)
Let me live (leave me alone)
Please let me live
(Why don't you live a little)
Oh yeah baby
(Why don't you give a little love...?)

Let me live
Please let me live
Oh yeah baby, let me live
And make a brand new start

Take another little piece of my heart now baby
Take another little piece of my heart now baby
Take another little piece of my soul now baby
Take another little piece of my life now baby
In your heart, oh baby
(Take another piece, take another piece)
Please let me live
(Take another piece, take another piece)
Why don't you take another piece
Take another little piece of my heart
Oh yeah baby
Make a brand new start
All you do is take
Let me live
"Made In Heaven" (Freddie Mercury)I'm taking my right with destiny
Willing to play my part
Living with painful memories
Loving with all my heart

Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be, yeah
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what they say
Can't you see
That's what everybody says to me
Can't you see
Oh I know, I know, I know, that it's true
Yes it's really meant to be
Deep in my heart

I'm having to learn to pay the price
They're turning me upside down
Waiting for possibilities
Don't see too many around
Made in heaven, yes made in heaven
It's for all to see
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Everybody says to me
It was really meant to be
Oh can't you see
Yeah, everybody, everybody says
Yes it was meant to be
Yeah, yeah

When stormy weather comes around
It was made in heaven
When sunny skies break through behind the clouds
I wish it could last forever, yeah
Wish it could last forever, forever

I'm playing my role in history
Looking to find my goal
Taking in all this misery
But giving it all my soul
Made in heaven, made in heaven
It was all meant to be
Made in heaven, made in heaven
That's what everybody says
Wait and see, it was really meant to be
So plain to see
Yeah, everybody, everybody, everybody tells me so
Yes it was plain to see, yes it was meant to be
Written in the stars...
Written in the stars...
"Mother Love" (May, Mercury)I don't want to sleep with you
I don't need the passion too
I don't want a stormy affair
To make me feel my life is heading somewhere
All I want is the comfort and care
Just to know that my woman gives me sweet -
Mother Love

I've walked too long in this lonely lane
I've had enough of this same old game
I'm a man of the world and they say that I'm strong
But my heart is heavy, and my hope is gone

Out in the city, in the cold world outside
I don't want pity, just a safe place to hide
Mama please, let me back inside

I don't want to make no waves
But you can give me all the love that I crave
I can't take it if you see me cry
I long for peace before I die
All I want is to know that you're there
You're gonna give me all your sweet -
Mother Love

My body's aching, but I can't sleep
My dreams are all the company I keep
Got such a feeling as the sun goes down
I'm coming home to my sweet -
Mother Love
"My Life Has Been Saved" (Queen)This is where we are today
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray

I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank the Lord above
My life has been saved

Here we go, telling lies
Here we go

We're right back where we started from
People going separate ways
This is the way things are now
In disarray

I read it in the papers
There's death on every page
Oh Lord, I thank you from above
My life has been saved

My life, my life has been saved
My life, my life, my life has been saved
"Too Much Love Will Kill You" (May, Musker, Lamers)I'm just the pieces of the man I used to be
Too many bitter tears are raining down on me
I'm far away from home
And I've been facing this alone
For much too long
I feel like no-one ever told the truth to me
About growing up and what a struggle it would be
In my tangled state of mind
I've been looking back to find
Where I went wrong

Too much love will kill you
If you can't make up your mind
Torn between the lover
And the love you leave behind
You're headed for disaster
'cos you never read the signs
Too much love will kill you
Every time

I'm just the shadow of the man I used to be
And it seems like there's no way out of this for me
I used to bring you sunshine
Now all I ever do is bring you down
How would it be if you were standing in my shoes
Can't you see that it's impossible to choose
No there's no making sense of it
Every way I go I'm bound to lose

Too much love will kill you
Just as sure as none at all
It'll drain the power that's in you
Make you plead and scream and crawl
And the pain will make you crazy
You're the victim of your crime
Too much love will kill you
Every time

Too much love will kill you
It'll make your life a lie
Yes, too much love will kill you
And you won't understand why
You'd give your life, you'd sell your soul
But here it comes again
Too much love will kill you
In the end...
In the end.
A Winter's Tale (Queen)It's Winter-fall
Red skies are gleaming - oh -
Sea-gulls are flyin' over
Swans are floatin' by
Smoking chimney-tops
Am I dreaming...
Am I dreaming...?

The nights draw in
There's a silky moon up in the sky - yeah -
Children are fantasising
Grown-ups are standin' by
What a super feeling
Am I dreaming...
Am I dreaming...?
woh-woh-woh-woh

(dreaming)
So quiet and peaceful
Tranquil and blissful
There's a kind of magic in the air
What a truly magnificent view
A breathtaking scene
With the dreams of the world
In the palm of your hand

(dreaming)
A cosy fireside chat
A little this, a little that
Sound of merry laughter skippin' by
Gentle rain beatin' on my face
What an extraordinary place!
And the dreams of the child
Is the hope of the man

It's all so beautiful
Like a landscape painting in the sky - yeah -
Mountains are zoomin' higher - mm -
Little girls scream an' cry
My world is spinnin' and spinnin' and spinnin'
It's unbelievable
Sends me reeling
Am I dreaming...
Am I dreaming...?
Oooh - it's bliss.
You Don't Fool Me (Queen)You don't fool me
You don't fool me...
Da, da da da dah

You don't fool me - those pretty eyes
That sexy smile - you don't fool me
You don't rule me - you're no surprise
You're telling lies - you don't fool me
Mmm, mama said be careful of that girl
Mama said you know that she's no good
Mama said be cool, don't you be no fool
Yup bup ba ba ba ba da da da dah !

You don't fool me, and break you
Sooner or later you'll be playing by her rules

Baby you don't fool me, yeah
You don't fool me, you don't have to say 'don't mind'
You don't have to teach me things I know
Sooner or later you'll playing by her rules
Oh, (fool you) oh, (rule you) she'll take you (take you)
And break you (break you)
Yeah

Mama said be cool

"All Dead, All Dead" (May)Memories, my memories 
How long can you stay 
To haunt my days 
She came without a farthing 
A babe without a name 
So much ado about nothing 
Is what she'd try to say 
So much ado my lover 
So many games we played 
Through every fleeted summer 
Through every precious day 

All Dead All Dead 
All the dreams we had 
And I wonder why I still live on 
All Dead All Dead 
And alone I'm spared 
My sweeter half instead 
All Dead 
And Gone 
All Dead... 

All Dead All Dead 
At the rainbow's end 
And still I hear her own sweet song 
All Dead All Dead 
Take me back again 
You know my little friend's 
All Dead 
And gone 
All Dead and gone 

Her ways are always with me 
I wander all the while 
But please you must forgive me 
I am old but still a child 

All Dead All Dead 
But I should not grieve 
In time it comes to everyone 
All Dead All Dead 
But in hope I breathe 
Of course I don't believe 
You're dead 
And gone 
All Dead 
And gone
"Fight From The Inside" (Taylor)Hey you boy, think that you know what you're doing 
You think you're gonna set things to rights 
You're just another picture on a teenage wall 
You're just another sucker ready for a fall 

You gotta 
Fight from the inside 
Attack from the rear 
Fight from the inside 

You can't win with your hands tied 
Fight from the inside 
Fight from the inside 
Right down the line - 

Hey you boy think that you know what you're doing 
You think that out in the streets is all free 
You're just another money-spinner tool 
You're just another fool 

You gotta 
Fight from the inside 
Attack from the rear 
Fight from the inside 

You can't win with your hands tied 
Fight from the inside 
Fight from the inside 
Right down the line �

"It's Late" (May)Scene 1 
You say you love me 
And I hardly know your name 
And if I say I love you in the candle light 
There's no one but myself to blame 
But there's something inside 
That's turning my mind away 
Oh how I could love you 
If I could let you stay 

Chorus 
It's late - and I'm bleeding deep inside 
It's late - is it just my sickly pride 
Too late - even now the feeling seems to slip away 

So late - though I'm crying I can't help but hear you say 
It's late It's late It's late 
But not too late 

Scene 2 
The way you love me 
Is the sweetest love around 
But after all this time 
The more I'm trying 
The more I seem to let you down 
Now you tell me you're leaving 
And I just can't believe it's true 
Oh you know that I can love you 
Though you know I can't be true
"Sheer Heart Attack" (Taylor)Well you're just 17 and all you wanna do is disappear 
You know what I mean there's a lot of space between your ears 
The way that you touch don't feel nothin' 
Hey hey hey hey, it was the DNA 
Hey hey hey hey, that made me this way 
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel 
Do you know, do you know, do you know, just how I feel 

Sheer heart attack 
Sheer heart attack 
Real cardiac 

I feel so in-articulate 

Gotta feelin', gotta feelin', gotta feelin', like I'm paralysed

Turn on the TV let it drip right down in your eyes

"Sleeping On The Sidewalk" (May)I was nothin' but a city boy 
My trumpet was my only toy 
I've been blowin' my horn 
Since I knew I was born 
But there ain't nobody wants to know 

I've been 
Sleepin' on the sidewalk 
Rollin' down the road 
I may get hungry 
But I sure don't want to go home 

So round the corner comes a limousine 
And the biggest grin I've ever seen 
Come on sonny won't you sign 
Right along the dotted line 
What you sayin' Are you playin' 
Sure you don't mean me? 

Sleepin' on the sidewalk 
Rollin' down the road 
I may get hungry 
But I sure don't wanna go home 

(tell you what happened. . .) 

They took me to a room without a table 
They said "blow your trumpet into here" 
I played around as well as I was able 
And soon we had the record of the year 

I was a legend all through the land 
I was blowin' to a million fans 
Nothin' was a-missin' 
All the people want to listen 
You'd have thought I was a happy man 

And I was 
Sleepin' like a princess 
Never touch the road 
I don't get hungry 
And I sure don't want to go home 
(have to have some fun. . .) 

Now they tell me that I ain't so fashionable 
An' I owe the man a million bucks a year 
So I told 'em where to stick the fancy label 
It's just me and the road from here 

Back to playin' and layin' 
I'm back on the game 

Sleepin' on the sidewalk 
Rollin' down the road 
I sure get hungry and I 
Sure do wanna go home 
(Yeah)
"Spread Your Wings" (Deacon)
Sammy was low 
Just watching the show 
Over and over again 
Knew it was time 
He'd made up his mind 
To leave his dead life behind 
His boss said to him 
"Boy you'd better begin 
To get those crazy notions right out of your head 
Sammy who do you think that you are? 
You should've been sweeping up the Emerald Bar" 

Spread your wings and fly away 
Fly away, far away 
Spread your little wings and fly away 
Fly away, far away 
Pull yourself together 
'Cos you know you should do better 
That's because you're a free man 

He spends his evenings alone in his hotel room 
Keeping his thoughts to himself, he'd be leaving soon 
Wishing he was miles and miles away 
Nothing in this world, nothing would make him stay 

Since he was small 
Had no luck at all 
Nothing came easy to him 
Now it was time 
He'd made up his mind 
"This could be my last chance" 
His boss said to him, "Now listen boy! 
You're always dreaming 
You've got no real ambition, you won't get very far 
Sammy boy, don't you know who you are? 
Why can't you be happy at the Emerald Bar?" 

So honey 

Spread your wings and fly away 
Fly away, far away 
Spread your little wings and fly away 
Fly away, far away 
Pull yourself together 
'Cos you know you should do better 
That's because you're a free man
"We Are The Champions" (Mercury)
I've paid my dues - 
Time after time - 
I've done my sentence 
But committed no crime - 
And bad mistakes 
I've made a few 
I've had my share of sand kicked in my face - 
But I've come through 

We are the champions - my friends 
And we'll keep on fighting - till the end - 
We are the champions - 
We are the champions 
No time for losers 
'Cause we are the champions - of the world - 

I've taken my bows 
And my curtain calls - 
You brought me fame and fortuen and everything that goes with it - 
I thank you all - 

But it's been no bed of roses 
No pleasure cruise - 
I consider it a challenge before the whole human race - 
And I ain't gonna lose - 

We are the champions - my friends 
And we'll keep on fighting - till the end - 
We are the champions - 
We are the champions 
No time for losers 
'Cause we are the champions - of the world �
"We Will Rock You" (May)

"Who Needs You" (Deacon)
I make it half past six you come at seven 
Always trying to keep me, hanging round 
You little spoilt thing, girl you kept me waiting 
Never contemplating my point of view 
This comes as no surprise 
I'm a fool, for I believed your lies 
But now I've seen through your disguise 
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you? 

Oh I believed you 
Went on my knees to you 
How I trusted you 
But you turned me down 
But it's dog eat dog in this rat race 
And it leaves you bleeding lying flat on your face 
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand 
Where is that helping hand? 

How I was pushed around 
"Don't let it get you down" 
You walked all over me 
"But don't you ever give in" 
Taking one step forward, slipping two steps back 
There's an empty feeling that you can't forget 
Reaching out, reaching out for a helping hand 

When I met you, you were always charming 
Couldn't sleep at night 'till you were mine 
You were oh so so sophisticated 
Never interested in what I'd say 
I had to swallow my pride 
So naive, you took me for a ride 
But now I'm the one to decide 
Who needs, well I don't need, who needs you?
Queen
"Doing All Right" (May, Staffel)
Yesterday my life was in ruins
Now today I know what I'm doing
Got a feeling I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Where will I be this time tomorrow?
Chasing joy or drinking in sorrow
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right

Simply waiting for the sign
Waiting here to find the words to say
Sitting waiting all this time here
All the time you're away
Sitting waiting for the sign
And anyway I got so far

Yesterday my life was in ruins
Now today I've learned what I'm doing
Anyway I should be doing all right
Doing all right
"Great King Rat" (Mercury)
Great King Rat died today
Born on the twenty first of May
Died syphillis forty four on his birthday
Every second word he swore
Yes he was the son of a whore
Always wanted by the law

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you
Would you like to see?

Where will I be tomorrow?
Will I beg or will I borrow?
I don't care I don't care anyway
Come on come on the time is right
I told you ah yes I told you
And that's no lie oh no no no

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know people?
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
Now what did I tell you?
Would you like to see?

Now listen all you people
Put out the good and keep the bad
Don't believe all you read in the Bible
You sinners get in line
Saints you leave far behind
Very soon you're gonna be h 
Don't listen to what mama says
Not a word not a word mama says
Or else you'll find yourself being the rival
The great Lord before He died
Knelt sinners by his side
And said you're gonna realise tomorrow

No I'm not gonna tell you
What you already know
'Cause time and time again
The old man said it all a long time ago
Come come on the time is right
This evil man will fight
I told you once before

Wouldn't you like to know?
Wouldn't you like to know?
Just like I said before
Great King Rat was a dirty old man
And a dirty old man was he
The last time I tell you?
Would you like to see?
"Jesus" (Mercury)
And then I saw Him in the crowd
A lot of people had gathered round Him
The beggers shouted and the lepers called Him
The old man said nothing
He just stared about Him
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down

Then came a man before His feet he fell
Unclean said the leper and rang his bell
Felt the palm of a hand touch his head
Go now go now you're a new man instead
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down

It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethelehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was the leader of man
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down

It all began with the three wise men
Followed a star took them to Bethelehem
And made it heard throughout the land
Born was the leader of man
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down to see the Lord Jesus
All going down
"Keep Yourself Alive" (May)
I was told a million times 
Of all the troubles in my way
How I had to keep on trying
Little better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Bread and butter for a smile
Well I sold a million mirrors
In a shop in Alley Way
But I never saw my face
In any window any day
Well they say your folks are telling you
To be a super star
But I tell you just be satisfied
To stay right where you are

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and a money
Honey you'll survive

Well I've loved a million women
In a belladonic haze
And I ate a million dinners 
Brought to me on silver trays
Give me ev'rything I need 
To feed my body and my soul
And I'll grow a little bigger
Maybe that can be my goal
I was told a million times 
Of all the people in my way
How I had to keep on trying
And get better ev'ry day
But if I crossed a million rivers
And I rode a million miles
Then I'd still be where I started
Still be where I started

Keep yourself alive keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money honey
You'll survive

Keep yourself alive
Keep yourself alive
It'll take you all your time and money

No I just think I'm two steps nearer to my grave
Keep yourself alive

Keep yourself alive

"Modern Times Rock 'n' Roll" (Taylor)
Had to make do with a worn out rock and roll scene
The old bop is gettin' tired need a rest
Well you know what I mean
Fifty eight that was great
But it's over now and That's all
Somethin' harder's coming up
Gonna really knock a hole in the wall
Gonna hit ya grab you hard
Make you feel ten feet tall

Well I hope this baby's gonna come along soon
You don't know it could happen any ol' rainy afternoon
With the temperature down
And the juke box blowin' no fuse
And my musical life's feelin
Like a long Sunday School cruise
And you know there's one thing
Every single body could use
Yeah listen to me baby
Let me tell you what it's all about
Modern times rock and roll
Modern times rock and roll

Get you high heeled guitar boots and some groovy clothes
Get a hair piece on your chest
And a ring through your nose
Find a nice little man who says
He's gonna make you a real big star
Stars in your eyes and ants in your pants
Think you should go far
Everybody in this bum sucking world
Gonna know just who you are
Look out

Modern times rock and roll
"My Fairy King" (Mercury)
In the land where horses born with eagle wings
And honey bees have lost their stings
There's singing forever
Lion's den with fallow deer
And rivers made from wine so clear
Flow on and on forever
Dragons fly like sparrows thru' the air
And baby lambs where Samson dares
To go on on on on on on

<first voice> <Second Voice>
My fairy king can see things He rules the air and turns the tides
That are not there for you and me Ohh yeah he guides the winds

My fairy king can do right and nothing wrong
Then came man to savage in the night
To run like thieves and to kill like knives
To take away the power from the magic hand
To bring about the ruin to the promised land

They turn the milk into sour
Like the blue in the blood of my veins
Why can't you see it
Fire burnin' in hell with the cry of screaming pain
Son of heaven set me free and let me go
Sea turn dry no salt from sand
Teeth don't shine like pearls for the poor man's eyes

Someone someone has drained the colour from my wings
Broken my fairy circle ring
And shamed the king in all his pride
Changed the winds and wronged the tides
Mother mercury (mercury)
Look what they've done to me
I cannot run I cannot hide
"Son And Daughter" (May)
Tried to be your son and daughter rolled into one
You said you'd equal any man for having your fun
Now didn't you feel surprise to find
The cap just didn't fit?
The world expects a man
To buckle down and to shovel shit

What'll you do for loving
When its only just begun?
I want you to be a woman

Tried to be a teacher and a fisher of men
An equal
Will you lead us all the same?
Well I travelled around the world
To find a brand new word for day
Watching the time mustn't linger behind
Pardon me I have to get away
What'll you think of heaven
If it's back from where you came?
I want you to be a woman
"The Night Comes Down" (May)
When I was young it came to me
And I could see the sun breakin'
Lucy was high and so was I dazzling
Holding the world inside
Once I believed in everyone
Everyone and anyone can see

Oh oh the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Oooh and it's dark again

Once I could laugh with everyone
Once I could see the good to me

Holding the world inside
Now all the world is grey to me
Nobody can see you gotta believe it

Oh oh the night comes down
And I get afraid of losing my way
Oh oh the night comes down
Oooh and it's dark again
And it's dark again
And it's dark again
Mad The Swine (Mercury)
I've been there before
A long time ago
But this time I wear no sandals
Ages past I gave all you people
Food and water
Three feet tall, so very small
I'm no trouble
I bring thunder and lightning
Sun and the rain
For all the people in the land
A message of love
I bring you from up above
All you children gather around
Come join your hands and sing along
They call me mad the swine
I guess I'm mad the swine
I've come to save you
Save you
Mad the swine
Mad the swine
So all you people gather around
Hold out your hands and praise the lord
I walk upon the water
Just as before
I help the meek and the mild
The believers and the blind
And all the creatures great and small
Let me take you to the river
Without a fall
Then one day you'll realise
You're all the same within his eyes
That's all I've got to say
Just like before
They call me mad the swine
Mad the swine
Come to save you
Save you
Mad the swine

Father To Son (May) 6:12
A word in your ear, from father to son
hear the words that I say
i fought with you, fought on your side
long before you were born

joyful the sound, the word goes around
from father to son, to son

and the voice is so clear, time after time it leeps
calling you, calling you on
don't destroy what you see, your country to be
just keep on building on the ground that's been won

kings will be crowned, the word goes around
from father to son, to son

take this letter that I give you,
take it sonny, hold it high
you won't understand a word that's in it
but you'll write it all again before you die

a word in your ear from father to son
funny you don't hear a single word I say
but my letter to you, will stay by your side
through the years till the loneliness is gone
sing if you will -
but the air you breathe I live to give you

father to son
father to, father to, father to son

joyful the sound, the word goes around
from father to son, to son...

kings will be crowned, the word goes around
from father to son, to son...

Nevermore (Mercury) 1:17
there's no living in my life anymore
the seas have gone dry and the rain stopped falling
please don't you cry anymore
can't you see
listen to the breeze, whisper to me please
don't send me to the path of nevermore

even the valleys below 
where the rays of the sun were so warn and tender
now haven't anything to grow
can't you see
why did you have to leave me
why did you deceive me
you send me to the path of nevermore
when you say you didn't love me anymore
nevermore

You never heard my song before the music was too loud
but now i think you hear me well for now we both know how
no star can light our way in this cloud of dark and fear
but some day, one day...

funny how the pages turn and hold us in between
a misty castle waits for you and you shall be a queen
today the cloud it hangs over us and all is grey
but some day, one day...

when i was you and you were me and we were very young
together took us nearly there the rest may not be sung
so still the cloud it hangs over us and we're alone
but some day, one day...
we'll come home
The Fairy Fellers Master-Stroke (Mercury) 2:39
He's a fairy feller
the fairy folk have gathered round the new moon shine
to see the feller crack a nut at nights noon time
to swing his ace he swears, as it climbs he dares
to deliver...
the master-stroke

ploughman, "waggoner will", and types
politician with senatorial pope - he's a dilly-dally-o
pedagogue squinting, wears a frown
and a satyr peers under lady's gown, dirty fellow
what a dirty laddio
tatterdemalion and a junketer
there's a thief and a dragonfly trumpeter - he's my hero
fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
the nymph in yellow "can we see the master-stroke"
what a quaere fellow

soldier, sailor, tinker, tailor, ploughboy
waiting to hear the sound
and the arch-magician presides
he is the leader
oberon and titania watched by a harridan
mab is the queen and there's a good apothecary-man
come to say hello
fairy dandy tickling the fancy of his lady friend
the nymph in yellow
what a quaere fellow
the ostler stares with hands on his knees
come on mr. feller, crack it open if you please
The Loser In The End (Taylor) 4:01
Mama's gotta problem
she don't know what to say
her little baby boy just left home today
she's got to be the loser in the end
she's got to be the loser in the end
misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
she's ma on whom you can always depend

she washed and fed, and clothed and cared
for nearly twenty years
and all she gets is "goodbye ma"
and the nightimes for her tears
she's got to be the loser in the end
she's got to be the loser in the end
misuse her and you'll lose her as a friend
she's ma on whom you can always depend

so listen mothers everywhere
to just one mother's son
you'll get forgotten on the way
if you don't let them have their fun
forget regrets, and just remember
it's so long since you were young

you're bound to be the loser in the end
you're bound to be the loser in the end
they'll choose their new shoes that's not far to bend
you're ma on whom they can always depend
The March Of The Black Queen (Mercury) 6:03
Do you mean it
do you mean it
do you mean it
why don't you mean it
why do i follow you and where do you go

you've never seen nothing like it no never in your life
like going up to heaven and then coming back alive
let me tell you all about it -
and the world will so allow it
ooh give me a little time to choose
water babies singing in a lily-pool delight
blue powder monkies praying in the dead of night

here comes the black queen, poking in the pile
fie-fo the black queen, marching single file
take this, take that, bring them down to size

put them in the cellar with the naughty boys
a little nigger sugar then a rub-a dub-a baby oil
black on, black on ever finger nail and toe
we've only begun - begun
make this make that, keep making all that noise
now i've got a belly-full
you can be my sugar-baby, you can be my honey chile, yes

a voice from behind me reminds me
spread out your wings you are an angel
remember to deliver with the speed of light
a little bit of love and joy
everything you do bears a will and a why and a wherefore
a little bit of love and joy
in each and every soul lies a man
and very soon he'll deceive and discover
but even till the end of his life, he'll bring a little love

i reign with my left hand, i rule with my right
i'm lord of all darkness, i'm queen of the night
i've got the power - now do the march of the black queen
my life is in your hands, i'll fo and i'll fie
i'll be a bad boy - i'll be your bad boy
i'll do the march of the black queen

walking true to style
she's vulgar 'buse and vile
fie-fo the black queen tattos all her pies
she boils and she bakes and she never dots her "i's"

forget your singalongs and your lullabies
surrender to the city of the fireflies
dance with the devil in beat with the band
to hell with all of you hand in hand
but now it's time to be gone � forever
White Queen (As It Began) (May) 4:33
So sad her eyes
smiling dark eyes
so sad her eyes
as it began

on such a breathless night as this
upon my brow the lightest kiss
i walked alone
and all around the air did say
my lady soon will stir this way
in sorrow known
the white queen walks and
the night grows pale
stars of lovingmess in her hair

needing - unheard
pleading - one word
so sad my eyes
she cannot see

how did thee fare, what have thee seen
the mother of the willow green
i call her name
and 'neath her window have i stayed
i loved the footsteps that she made
and when she came
white queen how my heart did ache
and dry my lips no word would make
so still i wait

my goddess hear my darkest fear
i speak too late
it's for evermore that i wait

dear friend goodbye
no tear in my eyes
so sad it ends
as it began

Sheer Heart Attack
"Brighton Rock" (May)
Happy little day, Jimmy went away
Met his little Jenny on a public holiday
A happy pair they made, so decorously laid
'Neath the gay illuminations all along the promenade
"It's so good to know there's still a little magic in the air
I'll weave my spell"

"Jenny will you stay - tarry with me pray
Nothing 'ere need come between us tell me love, what
do you say"
"Oh no I must away to my Mum in disarray
If my mother should discover how I spent my holiday
It would be of small avail to talk of magic in the air
I'll say farewell"

CHORUS

O Rock of Ages, do not crumble, love is breathing still
O Lady Moon, shine down a little people magic if you will

Jenny pines away, writes a letter everyday
"We must ever be together, nothing can my love erase"
"Oh no I'm compromised, I must apologise
If my lady should discover how I spent my holidays..."
"Bring Back That Leroy Brown" (Mercury)
CHORUS
Bring back, bring back
Bring back that Leroy Brown - yeah

Bring back, bring back
Gotta bring that Leroy Brown � back
"Dear Friends" (May)So dear friends your love has gone
Only tears to dwell upon
I dare not say as the wind must blow
So a love is lost, a love is won

Go to sleep and dream again
Soon your hopes will rise and then
From all this gloom life can start anew
And there'll be no crying soon
"Flick Of The Wrist" (Mercury)Dislocate your spine if you don't sign he says
I'll have you seeing double
Mesmerize you when he's tongue-tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see
The beast within him rise

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off
Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had.

Intoxicate your brain with what I'm saying
If not you'll lie in knee-deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried

Don't look back
Don't look back
It's a rip-off

Work my fingers to my bones
I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross-collateralize, (big-time money, money)
Reduce you to a muzak-fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a rip-off

Flick of the wrist and you're dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist - he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm, and taken a leg
All this time honey
Baby you've been had
"In The Lap Of The Gods Revisited" (Mercury)It's so easy, but I can't do it
So risky - But I gotta chance it
It's so funny, there's nothing to laugh about
My money, that's all you wanna talk about
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

It's in the lap of the Gods
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool

No beginning, there's no ending
There's no meaning in my pretending
Believe me, life goes on and on and on
Forgive me when I ask you where do I belong
You say I can't set you free from me
But that's not true

It's in the lap of the Gods
I can see what you want me to be
But I'm no fool
It's in the lap of the Gods
Wo wo la la la wo
Wo wo la la
Wah wah ooh
But that's not true
"In The Lap Of The Gods" (Mercury)I live my life for you
Think all my thoughts with you,
Anything you ask I do, for you
and only you
I touch your lips with mine
But in the end
I leave it to the lords
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
What more can I do

Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I leave it to you
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
Leave it in the lap of the Gods
I want you to
Leave it in the lap of the Gods

Lap of the Gods
"Killer Queen" (Mercury)She keeps Moet et Chandon
In her pretty cabinet
'Let them eat cake' she says
Just like Marie Antoinette
A built-in remedy
For Kruschev and Kennedy
At anytime an invitation
You can't decline

Caviar and cigarettes
Well versed in etiquette
Extraordinarily nice

CHORUS
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatine
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?

To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined

Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise

CHORUS

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat
Then momentarily out of action
Temporarily out of gas
To absolutely drive you wild, wild..
She's all out to get you

CHORUS

Recommended at the price
Insatiable an appetite
Wanna try?
You wanna try...
"Lily Of The Valley" (Mercury)I am forever searching high and low
But why does everybody tell me no
Neptune of the seas
Have you an answer for me please
And the lily of the valley doesn't know

I lie in wait with open eyes
I carry on through stormy skies
I follow every course
My kingdom for a horse
But each time I grow old
Serpent of the Nile
Relieve me for a while
And cast me from your spell and let me go

Messenger from Seven Seas has flown
To tell the King of Rhye he's lost his throne
Wars will never cease
Is there time enough for peace
But the lily of the valley doesn't know
"Misfire" (Deacon)Don't you misfire
Fill me up
With the desire
To carry on

Don't you know honey, that love's a game
It's always hit or miss, so take your aim
Got to hold on tight, shoot me out of sight

Don't you misfire...
Don't you misfire...

Your gun is loaded, and pointing my way
There's only one bullet, so don't delay
Got to time it right, fire me through the night

Come on, take a shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please don't misfire, misfire
"Now I'm Here" (May)Here I stand
Look around around around
But you won't see me

Now I'm here, Now I'm there, I'm just a...

Just a new man
Yes you made me live again

A baby I was when you took my hand
And the light of the night burned bright
And the people all stared didn't understand
But you knew my name on sight

Whatever came of you and me
America's new bride to be - don't worry baby I'm safe and sound

Down in the dungeon just Peaches 'n' me
Don't I love her so

A thin moon me in a smoke-screen sky
Where the beams of your lovelight chase
Don't move, don't speak, don't feel no pain
With a rain running down my face

Your matches still light up the sky
And many a tear lives on in my eye

Down in the city just Hoople 'n' me
Don't I love him so

Whatever comes of you and me
I love to leave my memory with you

Now I'm here
Think I'll stay around around around
We'll be down in the city justa you 'n' me
Don't I love you so
"She Makes Me" (Stormtrooper In Stilettoes) (May)I love
She makes me
She is my heart
She is my love

I know
I'm jealous of her
She makes me need
She is my love

Who knows who she'll make me
As I lie in her cocoon
And the world will surely heal my ills
I'm warm and terrified
She makes me so

I know the day I leave her
I'll love her still
She is my love
She is my love

She knows where my dreams will end
I'll follow as they grow
But the world will know how long I'll take
And if I'm very slow she makes me so

She is my love
"Stone Cold Crazy" (May, Mercury, Taylor, Deacon)Sleeping very soundly on a Saturday morning I was dreaming
I was Al Capone
There's a rumour going round, gotta clear outa town
I'm smelling like a dry fish bone
Here come the Law, gonna break down the door, gonna carry me
away once more
Never, never, never get it any more
Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Rainy afternoon I gotta blow a typhoon and I'm playing on
my slide trombone
Anymore, anymore, cannot take it anymore

Gotta get away from this stone cold floor
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know

Walking down the street, shooting people that I meet with
my rubber tommy water gun
Here come the deputy, he's gonna come and getta me
I gotta get me get up and run
They got the sirens loose
I ran outa juice
They're gonna put me in a cell, if I can't go to heaven
Will they let me go to hell
Crazy
Stone cold crazy, you know
"Tenement Funster" (Taylor)My new purple shoes, bin' amazin' the people next door
And my rock 'n roll 45's, bin' enragin' the folks on the lower floor

I got a way with girls on my block
Try my best be a real individual
And when we go down to Smokies and rock
They line up like it's some kinda ritual

Oh give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or, just give me an open car, I'll make the speed of light outta this place

I like the good things in life
But most of the best things ain't free
And this same situation, just cuts like a knife
When you're young, and you're poor, and you're crazy

But oh, give me a good guitar, and you can say that my hair's a disgrace
Or, just give me an open car, I'll make the speed of light outta this place
Bet Your Bottom Dollar Bill You're A PlayboyDaddy Cool with a ninety dollar smile
Took my money out of gratitude
And he git right outa town - well

I gotta getty up, steady up, shoot him down
Gotta hit that latitude - babe

[CHORUS REPEAT]

Big bad Leroy Brown he got no common
sense - no, no
He got no brains but he sure gotta lot of style
Can't stand no more in this here jail
I gotta rid myself of this sentence

Gotta get out the heat, step into the shade
Gotta get me there dead or alive - babe

Wooh, wooh, big bad Leroy, wooh, wooh,
Wooh, wooh, big bad Leroy - Brown - well

[CHORUS REPEAT]

Big Mama Lulu Belle she had a nervous breakdown
(She had a nervous breakdown)
Leroy's taken her honey chile away
But she met him down at the station
Put a shot gun to his head
And unless I be mistaken
This is what she said
"Big bad, big boy, big bad Leroy Brown
I'm gonna get that cutie pie"

[CHORUS REPEAT]
Big Bad Caused A Mighty Fine SensationGone and got himself elected president
(We want Leroy for President)

Next time, you gotta hit a bitty baddy
weather
This time, like a shimmy, shammy leather
He's a big boy, bad boy, Leroy
I don't care where you get him from

Bring that big bad Leroy back
Want him back
Smile
April Lady (S Lukas)She won our hearts the art she loved 
Is painting pictures free 
When she was done she hung them up 
For all the children to see 

Goodbye April Lady 
It's been good to have you around 
Goodbye April Lady 
You've done alot for the folks in this town 

Children learned to read 
She strung their beads 
It's sorry she was the one 
As you can isn't she good 
She don't leave nothing undone 

repeat 

She taught them all to love 
She was their cream 
And we don't want her to go 
But we know too well 
She fell in love 
And there's no stopping her now
BlagTake away my sunshine 
You take away my rain 
I can see it in you eyes 
There must be a dance floor somewhere 
You can find a way 
I can see it in your eye
Doin' Alright (Staffell, May)Yesterday my life was in ruin 
Now today I know what I'm doin' 
Gotta feelin' I should be doin' alright 
Doin' alright 

Where will I be this time tommorow 
Jumping with joy or sinking in sorrow 
Anyway I should be doin' alright 
Doin' alright 

Should be waiting for the sun 
Anyway I've got to hide 
Going back to where the skies are blue 
Going home to find the one
Earth (Staffell)I might be at a table 
And suddenly I'll catch 
A fleeting vision of her crystal seas 
Or I might be standing in a crowded dockyard faraway 
Beneath the sun I've never seen 
'Cos I have seen many worlds 
For what it's worth 
But I'll never see again 
The planet earth 
My earth 
I might be chasing waves of light 
Out towards the grim 
Where stars are sparse 
And the cold of space seeps in 
But I might be in a barroom 
Drinking menthylated gin 
And thinking of places I have been 

Yes I have seen many worlds 
For what it's worth 
But I'll never see again the planet earth 
My earth 

Cast adrift amongst the stars 
I float from sun to sun 
Dreaming of the world that gave me birth 
All the places I have been 
Remind me there is none to match the green living hills of earth.
Polar BearIn the bright shop window sits the polar bear 
Makes the children's eyes light up to see him there 
Amongst the tinsel he gives everyone a smile 
To see him and he'll be a star 
Love him from where you are 

He's not for, not for, not for sale 

Past an open window walks the pretty girl 
Does she see me at her feet its hard to tell 
But if I ask her she might turn her smile away 
To see him and he'll be a star 
Love her from where you are 

I guess I'll learn to look 
Without addressing her 
Minor contentment wears a smile 
I love her from where I lie

"Contact"Feeling strange, turn around do it again 
Feeling alright, feel like contact tonight 
Well you know what it says and you know what you feel 
And you know what it's like and you know it's for real 
Take it to the limit, take it to the height 
Take it to the limit, contact tonight 
Don't speak, don't break the spell 
Let's dance, you dance so well 
I contact you, you contact me 
Across the room our glances meet 
I contact you, eye contact, eye contact 
Feeling fine, feel like dynamic 
Eyes speak more than words can say 
Sparks fly eye contact is made 
Well you know what it says 
And you know what you feel 
Well you know what it's like 
And you know it's for real 
So take it to the limit, take it to the height 
Take it to the limit, contact tonight 
Breathe deep let your feelings show, 
Let's dance but not too slow 
I contact you, you contact me, across the room 
Our glances meet, I contact you... 
Eye contact, eye contact 
Take it to the limit, take it to the limit, 
Eye contact, eye contact...
"Cowboys And Indians"It's a long fast dance 
Well the long fast dance of progress 
And the long slow waltz of decay 
Made such a natural born couple 
They settled down right here in the USA 
Dream home for two in the USA 
Hot jazz, cool blues, we got country 
We get rock and roll all day 
Like to dance, come on down get funky 
That's the way, that's the way 
That's the way hey, hey in the USA 
There's still cowboys and indians at home on the range 
But the cowboys and indians have changed - they've changed 
We've got James Dean on the silver screen 
We've got James Brown he won't let you down 
Now Elvis was the king of rock and roll 
We got preacher men who want to save your soul 
Got the motorcity with the Motown beat 
Get hip to the beat on the hip hop street 
Stars and bars and the biggest cars 
And a rocket ship take you up to Mars 
There's the east coast trip where it's real uptight 
Where you work all day and you play all night 
And the west coast side with the laid back scene 
When you just lay back and it seems like a dream 
There's a lot of places in between 
There's Hollywood and the city by the bay 
And the whole damn south down Louisiana way, way, way 
That's the way, that's the way hey, hey in the USA 
There's still cowboys and indians at home on the range 
But the cowboys and indians have changed, the've changed 
In the land of the free and the home of the brave 
The cowboys and cowgirls and indians have changed 
Baby, baby, baby 
That's the way, that's the way in the USA 
Cowboys and indians... 
Home on the range...
"Heaven For Everyone"While you are imagining, imagine for instance, 
The sights that you can take advantage of 
Look at the beautiful cloud formations below you and above you 
This could be heaven 
Think of the colour of the sun as it shines off the clouds 
In these days, in these days, in these days of cool reflection 
You come to me and everything seems alright 
In these days of cold affections 
You sit by me and everything's fine 
This could be heaven for everyone 
This world could be fed, this world could be fun 
This could be heaven for everyone 
This world could be free, this world could be one, 
In this world of cool deception 
Just smile can smooth my ride 
These troubled days of cruel rejection 
You come to me, soothe my troubled mind 
Yeah, this could be heaven for everyone 
This world could be fed, this world could be one 
We should bring love to our daughters and sons 
Love, love, love, love 
(This could be heaven for everyone) 
So take a seat and sit by my side a while 
You know I like your style 
(This could be heaven for everyone) 
So what can we do to clean up this mess 
Just feel so helpless 
This could be heaven for everyone 
So lift up your voice at least you'll have cared 
At least you'll have dared 
Listen. What people do to other souls 
They take their lives, destroy their goals 
Their basic pride and dignity 
Is stripped and torn and shown no pity 
When this should be heaven for everyone 
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone 
This could be heaven, could be heaven for everyone etc. 
And this is the end of this section.
"Love Lies Bleeding (She Was A Wicked Wily Waitress)"Come on, come on 
She was a waitress she looked real tine 
The little temptress was so divine 
A symphony of cheap perfume and pretty stale red wine 
She can wait upon my table anytime 
She was poetry in motion 
Stiletto heels and nylons she moved up to the table 
I could see she had a burger with my fries on 
Love lies bleeding, listen to this, love lies bleeding 
Well we parked outside a city bank 
We found it all real funny 
The car was running on all tanks and we stole all the money 
She was a wicked wily waitress and she should be doing time 
She was an ordinary waitress now she owns her own goldmine 
How 'bout that 
Love lies bleeding, now listen to this, love lies bleeding 
She was a rebel without a cause 
She was a girl who needed applause 
Love in the future, love in the past 
Love lies bleeding in our path 
Would you believe that it gets worse 
She had a loud theatrical whisper 
I had a one way ticket to Palookaville 
She had an equally dangerous sister 
I was out of my league, they were in for the kill 
She was a wicked wily waitress 
And I gave her all my trust 
She took the loot, gave me the boot 
Now she's rich and I'm flat bust 
Yeah love lies bleeding 
Now that was the limit because 
She was a rebel without a cause 
She was a girl who needed applause 
Love in the future, love in the past 
Love in the future, love in the past 
Love lies bleeding in our path 
I dreamed this world was quite alright, 
And everyone meant well 
When I awoke to my surprise 
I found myself in hell
"Love On A Tightrope (Like An Animal)"Listen - trapped again 
Love on a lead is what you need 
Love on a leash is what you wish 
Love on a tightrope is what you get 
Love on a steep slope you ain't seen nothing yet 
When you smile, that wide wide smile 
That tiger smile, I'm trapped again 
Be my dog, be my pet, like a nervous tic 
You just won't quit, like a nervous tic you just won't quit 
You don't need a doctor, you need a vet 
And when you laugh, your crazy laugh 
That wild cat laugh, I'm trapped again 
Love on a tightrope, love on a tightrope 
Our love's on a steep slope 
Love on a tightrope 
No don't give up hope 'Cos when you wish upon a star 
Makes no difference who you are 
Don't give up hope our love's on a tightrope 
Like a tiger cat you're where it's at 
Like a crocodile along the Nile 
So strange and wild, some kind of reptile 
Love on a lead is what you need 
And when you smile, that wide wild smile 
That tiger smile, I'm trapped again 
Trapped again 
They say never bite the hand that feeds 
Just one look and my heart bleeds 
Love on a tightrope, love on a tightrope 
You know, our love's on a steep slope 
Love on a tightrope 
No don't give up hope, 'Cos when you wish upon a star 
Makes no difference who you are 
Don't give up hope our love's on a tightrope 
Animal eyes - like a real good time 
Animal lips it's a perfect crime 
Animal hair it just ain't fair 
Like an animal 
You're an animal
"Rough Justice"Your criminal eyes, that see straight through 
We criminalise - your kind of voodoo 
Make me sell my soul for the easy life 
Sell my mother, trade in my wife 
Rough justice - alright - rough justice on the streets tonight
"Shove It"What do you do? I said what do you do? 
You ain't wearin' a tie, you ain't got a jacket 
You can't come in 'cos you're in the wrong bracket 
You can shove it 
VIP's and royalty get treated like they're special see 
But the trick is there for all to see 
They're people just like you and me 
You can shove it 
Girls - we love it 
Cars - we love it 
More girls - we love it 
Late night bars - we love it 
Pool - we love it 
School - fantasy 
What do you do? 
You can shove it 
You gotta talk, act and dress right 
If you ain't got money, they treat ya funny 
When they say the class system's dead 
If you think that's true better get a new head 
You can shove it 
You can shove it 
You can shove it 
Girls - we love it 
Cars - we love it 
More girls - we love it 
And late night bars - we love it 
Pool - we love it 
School - shove it 
What do you do? 
Shove it, 
You can shove it. 
So why do people scrape and fuss 
When everyman's the same as us 
It's a joke on all humanity 
It's privilege 
And we don't need it 
War - shove it 
Hate - shove it 
Politicians - don't cut it 
Blind dates - shove it 
Girls schools - we love it 
Crazy rules - shove it 
What do you do? 
You can shove it 
You can shove it...etc.
"Stand Up For Love"Clap your hands and let's groove 
Clap your hands, clap your hands 
There comes a time in every life 
There comes a day in every mind 
Now don't look back, don't look behind 
Stand up straight in your own time 
Stand up for love, every good man 
Stand up for love, and foolish man 
Stand up for love, and all the rich men 
Stand up for love, and all the proud men 
Stand up for love, stand up for love, stand up for love 
Everybody, come on and take my hand 
Everybody, you know it's time, 
It's time to make your stand... 
Clap your hands and let's groove 
In case of fear, in case of fire, in case of some 
Kinda, earthquake, or forest fire 
I got my man, I got my man, right in my sights - 
He looks to the left, leans to the right 
You know I want you to now 
Stand up for love, every good man 
Stand up for love, and every foolish man 
And every rich man, and every proud man 
Stand up for love, stand up for love 
Everybody, come on and take my hand 
I said everybody you know it's time to make your stand 
Die for love, this is a cry for love 
Let's fly for love, gotta die for love 
Stand up for love, stand up for love...
The Game
"Another One Bites The Dust" (Deacon)Steve walks warily down the street, 
with the brim pulled way down low 
Ain't no sound but the sound of his feet, 
machine guns ready to go 
Are you ready, Are you ready for this 
Are you hanging on the edge of your seat 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip 
To the sound of the beat 

Another one bites the dust 
Another one bites the dust 
And another one gone, and another one gone 
Another one bites the dust 
Hey, I'm gonna get you too 
Another one bites the dust 

How do you think I'm going to get along, 
without you, when you're gone 
You took me for everything that I had, 
and kicked me out on my own 

Are you happy, are you satisfied 
How long can you stand the heat 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip 
To the sound of the beat 

Chorus 

Another one bites the dust 
Another one bites the dust 
Another one bites the dust 
Another one bites the dust 
There are plenty of ways you can hurt a man 
And bring him to the ground 
You can beat him 
You can cheat him 
You can treat him bad and leave him 
When he's down 
But I'm ready, yes I'm ready for you 
I'm standing on my own two feet 
Out of the doorway the bullets rip 
repeating the sound of the beat
"Coming Soon"Oooooooooo x n 
Oh Oh Oh x n 
I get some headaches when I hit the heights 
Like in the morning after crazy nights 
Like some month in law in her nylon tights 
They're always 
They're always 
They're always 
They're always 
Coming soon, 
Coming soon, on the outside, of the tracks, 
You take 'em 
The same old babies with the same old toys, 
The neighbours screaming when the noise annoys, 
Somebody naggin' you when you're out with the boys 
They're always 
They're always 
They're always 
They're always 
Coming soon, 
Coming soon, on the outside, of the track 
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah. 
Watch me now, 
They're always 
They're always 
They're always 
They're always 
Coming soon, 
Coming soon, on the outside, of the track 
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah.

Take me to the room where the green's all green 
And from what I've seen it's hot, it's mean

And the white's are black, take me back to the shack

"Need Your Loving Tonight"No I'll never, look back in anger, 
No I'll never, find me an answer, 
You promised me, you'd keep in touch 
I read your letter and it hurt me so much 
I said I'd never, never be angry with you. 

I don't wnna feel like a stranger 
Cos I'd rather be in danger 
I read your letter so many times 
I got your meaning between the lines 
I said I'd never, never be angry with you 

I must be strong so she won't know how much I miss her 

I only hope as time goes on, I'll forget her 
My body's aching, can't sleep at night 
I'm too exhausted to start a fight 
And if I see her with another guy 
I'll eat my heart out 'cos I love her, 
love her, love her, love her 

Come on baby, let's get together 
I'll love you baby, I'll love you forever 
I'm trying hard, to stay away 
What made you change, what did I say? 
Ooh I need your loving tonight
	
"Rock It (Prime Jive)"When I hear that rock and roll, 
It gets down to my soul, 
When it's real rock and roll, oh rock and roll.

On the radio 
I said Mama

"Sail Away Sweet Sister (To The Sister I Never Had)" (May)Hey little babe you're changing 
Babe, are you feeling sore? 
Ain't no use in pretending 
You don't wanna play no more 

It's plain that you ain't no baby 
What would your mother say 
You're all dressed up like a lady 
How come you behave this way 

Sail Away Sweet Sister 
Sail across the sea 
Maybe you find somebody 
Who loves you half as much as me 
My heart is always with you 
No matter what you do 
Sail away sweet sister 
Always be in love with you 

Forgive me for what I told you 
My heart makes a fool of me 
You know I'll never hold you 
I know that you gotta be free 

Sail Away Sweet Sister 
Sail across the sea 
Maybe you find somebody 
Who loves you half as much as me 
Take it the way you want it 
But when they let you down my friend 
Sail away sweet sister 
Back to my arms again 

Hot child don't you know, you're young - 
You've got your whole life ahead of you 
Oohah - You can throw it away too soon 
Way too soon
"Save Me" (May)It started off so well 
They said we made a perfect pair 
I clothed myself in your glory and your love 
How I loved you, 
How I cried..... 
The years of care and loyalty 
Were nothing but a sham it seems 
The years belie we lived a lie 
"I'll love you 'til I die" 

Save me Save me Save me 
I can't face this life alone 
Save me Save me Oh... 
I'm naked and I'm far from home 

The slate will soon be clean 
I'll erase the memories, 
To start again with somebody new 
Was it all wasted 
All that love?..... 
I hang my head and I advertise 
A soul for sale or rent 
I have no heart, I'm cold inside 
I have no real intent 

Save me Save me Save me 
I can't face this life alone 
Save me Save me Oh... 
I'm naked and I'm far from home 

Each night I cry, I still believe the lie 
I'll love you 'til I die 

All (c) 1980, except Crazy Little Thing Called Love (c) 1979 
The Miracle
"Breakthru" (Queen)When love breaks up
When the dawn light wakes up
A new life is born
Somehow I have to make this final breakthru . . . Now!

I wake up
Feel just fine,
Your face
Fills my mind
I get religion quick
'Cos you're looking divine
Honey you're touching something, you're touchin' me,
I'm under your thumb, under you're spell, can't you see,
If I could only reach you,
If I could make you smile,
If I could only reach you,
That would really be a breakthru - oh yeah.

Breakthru, these barriers of pain,
Breakthru, to the sunshine from the rain,
Make my feelings known towards you
Turn my heart inside and out for you now
Somehow,
I have to make this final breakthru.
Now!

Your smile,
Speaks books to me,
I break up,
With each and every one of your looks at me,
Honey you're starting something deep inside of me,
Honey you're sparking something, this fire in me,
I'm outta control, I wanna rush headlong into this ecstasy
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
If I could only reach you
If I could make you smile,
If I could only reach you
That would really be a breakthru
Breakthru, breakthru
"Hang On In There" (Queen)Don't let go, don't lose your mystique,
Wait a little longer,
Tomorrow brings another feast,
Don't let go, don't lose your reputation,
Thank god you're still alive,
You're still in one piece,
Hang on in there, don't lose your appetite,
Hang on in there, forget the danger signs,
Fray for that magical moment and it will appear
(Don't fight for lost emotions,)
Wait for the sunrise,
And everything will seem so clear,
(Look straight ahead, look straight ahead,)
Hang on in there, hang on in there, hang on in there,
Your wish will be granted,
All your problems will disappear,
Don't be a fool, you haven't reached your peak,
You got a fast car racing up inside you,
Your life is incomplete,
Hang on in there, hang on in there,
Fray for that magical moment and it will appear
(Wait for that moment),
Wait for the sunrise,
Just wait and see and it will seem so clear,
Let's go, let's go - OK now do the change now,
Yeah, hang on in there,
Hang on in there etc.
"I Want It All" (Queen)Adventure seeker on an empty street,
Just an alley creeper, light on his feet
A young fighter screaming, with no time for doubt
With the pain and anger can't see a way out,
It ain't much I'm asking, I heard him say,
Gotta find me a future move out of my way,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

Listen all you people, come gather round
I gotta get me a game plan, gotta shake you to the ground
Just give me what I know is mine,
People do you hear me, just give me the sign,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth
Here's to the future for the dreams of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,

I'm a man with a one track mind,
So much to do in one life time (people do you hear me)
Not a man for compromise and where's and why's and living lies
So I'm living it all, yes I'm living it all,
And I'm giving it all, and I'm giving it all,
It ain't much I'm asking, if you want the truth,
Here's to the future, hear the cry of youth,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
I want it all, I want it all, I want it all, and I want it now,
etc.
"Khashoggi's Ship" (Queen)Who said that my party was all over, huh, huh,
I'm in pretty good shape,
The best years of my life are like a super nova,
Huh, huh, perpetual craze, I said that
Everybody drank my wine -you get my drift,
And then we took a holiday on Khashoggi's ship - well,
We really had a good good time they was all so sexy
We was bad, we was blitzed,
All in all it was a pretty good trip,
This big bad sucker with a fist as big as your head,
Wanted to get me, I said go away
I said kiss my ass honey,
He pulled out a gun, wanted to arrest me,
I said uh, uh, babe,
Now listen no-one stops my party,
No-one stops my party,
No-one, no-one, no-one stops my party,
Just like I said,
We were phased, we was pissed,
Just having a total eclipse,
This one's on me so let us do it just right,
This here one party don't get started 'till midnight,
Party to the left -
Party to the right -
Left - right
No-one stops my .....
"My Baby Does Me" (Queen)My baby
Baby does
My baby does, me good
My baby does
May baby does me
My baby does me good

My lady
Understands
Understands me, right

She understands me
She understands me
Understands me right
My baby cares
She really cares
She knows what's really right for me
Does me good then she hurts me so
She winds me up then lets me go
Turns me on and then tells me no
She's just a pussy cat

My baby loves me
My baby loves me
My baby cuffs me
One day she tells me that she cares
Another day she tells me she don't love me
She really really does me
"Party"We had a good night jamming away,
There was a fullmoon showing,
And we started to play,
But in the cold light of day next morning
Party was over,
The party was over.

We got love and we got style,
And we got sex and I know we got what it takes oh, oh,
Why don't you come back and play,
Come back and play, come back and play,
We got all night all day,
Everybody's gone away,
Why don't you come back and play, come back and play, come back and play,
Come back and play, Go get 'em boy - let's party,
We had a food fight in somebody's face,
We were up all night singing
And giving a chase,
But in the cold light of day next morning.
Everybody was hung-over.
Come back and play, come back and play,
We got all night all day,
Everybody's gone away,
Why don't you come back and play,
Come back and play,
We got all night and we got all day,
We got all night to play,
Come back, comeback, comeback, comeback, comeback and play,
Goodbye, Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, the party is over.
"Rain Must Fall" (Queen)I can see it in your stars
Life is so exciting,
Acting so bizarre
Your world is so inviting
Playing really cool
And looking so mysterious
Your every day is full of sunshine
But into every life a little rain must fall.

Anyone who imagines
They can blind you with science
Bully you all over
With property and finance
But you have position
To call the shots and name the price
You found success and recognition
But into every life a little rain must fall

You lead a fairy tale existence
But into every life a little rain must fall

Others seem to think
You are over dramatising
Problems at work
So it's hardly surprising
There's little you can do
To alter their opinions
You want a clean reputation
But now you're facing complications
'Cos into every life a little rain must fall
"Scandal" (Queen)Scandal - now you've left me all the world's gonna know
Scandal, they're gonna turn our lives into a freak show,
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break,
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for Gods sake,
Over and over and over again,
Scandal - now you've left me there's no healing the wounds,
Hey scandal, and all the world can make us out to be fools,
Here come the bad news, open the floodgates
They'll leave us bleeding, we say you cheapskates,
Over and over and over again,
So let them know when they stare, it's just a private affair,
They'il have us hung in the air and tell me what do they care,
It's only a life to be twisted and broken,
They'll see the heart-ache, they'll see our love break - yeah,
They'll hear me pleading, I'll say for Gods sake,
Over and over and over and over again,
Scandal, scandal,
Scandal, yes you're breaking my heart again,
Today the headlines, tomorrow hard times,
And no-one really knows the truth from the lies,
And in the end the story deeper must hide,
Deeper and deeper and deeper inside,
Scandal, scandal etc ......
"The Invisible Man" (Queen)I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man,
Incredible how you can,
See right through me,

When you hear a sound,
That you just can't place
Feel somethin' move
That you just can't trace,
When something sits
On the end of your bed
Don't turn around
When you hear me tread.

I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you.

Now I'm in your room
And I'm in your bed
And I'm in your life
And I'm in your head
Like the CIA
Or the FBI
You'll never get close
Never take me alive

I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you,

Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello,
Hah, hah, hah, hello-hello-hello-hello,
Never had a real good friend - not a boy or a girl
No-one knows what I've been through - let my flag unfurl
So make my mark from the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,
From the edge of the world,

Now I'm on your track
And I'm in your mind,
And I'm on your back
But don't look behind
I'm your meanest thought
I'm your darkest fear
Put I'll never get caught
You can't shake me, shake me dear,

I'm the invisible man,
I'm the invisible man
Incredible how you can
See right through me
I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man
It's criminal how I can
See right through you
Look at me, look at me
"The Miracle" (Queen)Every drop of rain that falls in Sahara Desert says it all,
It's a miracle,
All God's creations great and small, the Golden Gate and the Taj Mahal,
That's a miracle,
Test tube babies being born, mothers, fathers dead and gone,
It's a miracle,
We're having a miracle on earth, mother nature does it all for us,
The wonders of this world go on, the hanging Gardens of Babylon,
Captain Cook and Cain and Able, Jimi Hendrix to the Tower of Babel
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle,
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on earth - an end to war,
It's a miracle we need - the miracle, the miracle we're all waiting for today,
If every leaf on every tree, could tell a story that would be a miracle,
If every child on every street, had clothes to wear and food to eat,
That's a miracle,
If all God's people could be free, to live in perfect harmony,
It's a miracle, we're having a miracle on earth,
Mother nature does it all for us
Open hearts and surgery, Sunday mornings with a cup of tea,
Super powers always fighting,
But Mona Lisa just keeps on smiling,

The wonders of this world go on,
It's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle, it's a miracle,
The one thing we're all waiting for, is peace on earth and an end to war,
It's a miracle we need, the miracle, the miracle,
Peace on earth and end to war today,
That time will come one day you'll see when we can all be friends,
repeat ........
"Was It All Worth It" (Queen)What is there left for me to do in this life.
Did I achieve what I had set in my sights.
Am I a happy man, or is this sinking sand,
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it.
Yeah, now hear my story, let me tell you about it,
We bought a drum kit. blew my own trumpet.
Played the circuit, thought we were perfect,
Was it all worth it. giving all my heart and soul and
Staying up all night, was it all worth it,
Living breathing rock n'roll, a godforsaken life,
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it all these years.
Put down our money without counting the cost,
It didn't matter if we won - if we lost,
Yes we were vicious. yes we could kill,
Yes we were hungry. yes we were brill,
We served a purpose, like a bloody circus,
We were so dandy we love you madly,
Was it all worth it. was it all worth it,
Living breathing rock n'roll, this godforsaken life,
Was it all worth it. was it all worth it,
When the hurly burly's done -
We went to Bali, saw God and Dali.
So mystic, surrealistic,
Was it all worth it, giving all my heart and soul,
Staying up all night, was it all worth it,
Living breathing rock n'roll this never ending fight,
Was it all worth it, was it all worth it,
Yes, it was a worthwhile experience,
It was worth it.

The Works
"Hammer To Fall" (May)Here we stand or here we fall
History won't care at all
Make the bed, light the light
Lady Mercy won't be home tonight.

CHORUS
You don't waste no time at all
Don't hear the bell but you answer the call
It comes to you as to us all
We're just waiting
For the hammer to fall


Oh every night, and every day
A little piece of you is falling away
But lift your face, the Western Way -
Build your muscles as your body decays.

CHORUS
Tow the line and play their game
Let the anaesthetic cover it all
Till one day they call your name
You know it's time for the Hammer to Fall.

Rich or poor or famous for
Your truth it's all the same
Lock your door but rain is pouring
Through your window pane
Baby now your struggle's all vain.

For we who grew up tall and proud
In the shadow of the Mushroom Cloud
Convinced our voices can't be heard
We just wanna scream it louder and louder

CHORUS
What the hell are we fighting for?
Just surrender and it won't hurt at all
You just got time to say your prayers
While you're waiting for the Hammer to Fall.
"I Go Crazy" (May)I took my baby to see a heavy band
But I never saw my baby 'till the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't wanna cry 'cause I had to be cool
I didn't wanna tell you that you're too cruel
Did you have to run off with that dog-gone fool?

All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby

I wouldn't mind the postman if the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man the electric man - man to fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock 'n roll clone
Leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?

All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby

So I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more
no more

I don't wanna go see Queen no more no more

Now I don't wanna hurt you like you been a-hurting me
But you know that I'll be watching
Rolling on the floor next time you're on TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoilt brat
To think that I nearly let you get away with all that
No way man

All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
"I Want To Break Free" (Deacon)I want to break free
I want to break free
I want to break free from your lies
You're so self satisfied I don't need you
I've got to break free
God knows, God knows I want to break free.

I've fallen in love
I've fallen in love for the first time

And this time I know it's for real
I've fallen in love, yeah
God knows, God knows I've fallen in love.

It's strange but it's true
I can't get over the way you love me like you do
But I have to be sure
When I walk out that door
Oh how I want to be free, baby
Oh how I want to be free,
Oh how I want to break free.

But life still goes on
I can't get used to, living without, living without,
Living without you by my side
I don't want to live alone, hey
God knows, got to make it on my own
So baby can't you see
I've got to break free.

I've got to break free
I want to break free, yeah
I want, I want, I want, I want to break free.
"Is This The World We Created ?" (Mercury, May)Just think of all those hungry mouths we have to feed
Take a look at all the suffering we breed
So many lonely faces scattered all around
Searching for what they need.

Is this the world we created
What did we do it for
Is this the world we invaded
Against the law
So it seems in the end
Is this what we're all living for today
The world that we created.

You know that everyday a helpless child is born
Who needs some loving care inside a happy home
Somewhere a wealthy man is sitting on his throne
Waiting for life to go by.

Is this the world we created, we made it on our own
Is this the world we devasted, right to the bone
If there's a God in the sky looking down
What can he think of what we've done
To the world that He created.
"It's A Hard Life" (Mercury)I don't want my freedom
There's no reason for living with a broken heart.

This is a tricky situation -
I've only got myself to blame
It's just a simple fact of life
It can happen to anyone -

You win - you lose
It's a chance you have to take with love
Oh yeah - I fell in love
But now you say it's over and I'm falling apart.

It's a hard life
To be true lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts -
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another right from the start
When you're in love -

I try and mend the broken pieces
I try to fight back the tears
They say it's just a state of mind
But it happens to everyone -

How it hurts - deep inside
When your love has cut you down to size
Life is tough - on your own
Now I'm waiting for something to fall from the skies
Waiting for love.

Yes it's a hard life
Two lovers together
To love and live forever in each others hearts
It's a long hard fight
To learn to care for each other
To trust in one another - right from the start
When you're in love -
Yes it's a hard life
In a world that's filled with sorrow
There are people searching for love in every way -

It's a long hard fight -
But I'll always live for tomorrow
I'll look back on myself and say I did it for love
Yes I did it for love - for love - oh I did it for love.
"Keep Passing The Open Windows" (Mercury)This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

Do you know what it's like to be alone in this world
When you're down and out on your luck and you're a failure
Wake up screaming in the middle of the night
You think it's all been a waste of time
It's been a bad year
You start believing everything's gonna be alright
Next minute you're down and you're flat on your back
A brand new day is beginning
Get that sunny feeling and you're on your way.

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Do you know how it feels when you don't have a friend
Without a job and no money to spend
You're a stranger

All you think about is suicide
One of these days you're gonna lose the fight
You better keep out of danger - yeah
That same old feeling just keeps burning deep inside
You keep telling yourself it's gonna be the end
Oh get yourself together
Things are looking better everyday

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows
Just believe - just keep passing the open windows.

This is the only life for me
Surround myself around my own fantasy
You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

You just gotta be strong and believe in yourself
Forget all the sadness cause love is all you need.

Love is all you need - baby - love is all you need.

Just believe - just keep passing the open windows.
"Machines (Or 'back To Humans')" (May, Taylor)It's a Machine's world
Don't tell me I ain't got no soul
When the machines take over
It ain't no place for you and me.

They tell me I don't care
But deep inside I'm just a man
They freeze me they burn me
They squeeze me they stress me
With smoke-blackened pistons of steel they compress me
But no-one, but no-one, but no-one can wrest me away
Back to Humans.

We have no disease, no troubles of mind
No thank you please, no regard for the time
We never cry, we never retreat
We have no conception of love or defeat.

What's that Machine noise
It's bytes and megachips for tea
It's that Machine, boys
With Random Access Memory
Never worry, never mind
Not for money, not for gold.

It's software it's hardware
It's heartbeat is time-share
It's midwife's a disk drive
It's sex-life is quantised
It's self-perpetuating a parahumanoidarianised.

Back to Humans
Back to Humans.

Back to Machines.

Living in a new world
Thinking in the past
Living in a new world
How you gonna last
Machine world...
It's a Machine's world...

Change.

Back to Humans.
"Man On The Prowl" (Mercury)I'm gonna take a little walk on the wild side
I'm gonna loosen up and get me some gas
I'm gonna get me some action
Go crazy, driving in the fast lane
My baby left me alone
She done me dirty and I'm feeling so lonely
So come home, come home
If you don't you're gonna break my heart.

Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out - look out
I'm a man on the prowl.

I don't wanna be a rock 'n' roll steady
I just wanna be low down trash
I wanna go to the movies
All I wanna do is sit on my ass
So honey come home
Don't leave me when I'm feeling so lonely
Come home - come home
If you don't you're gonna break my heart.

Man on the prowl
You better watch out
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
So look out - look out
I'm a man on the prowl.

Well I keep dreaming about my baby
But it ain't gonna get me nowhere
I wanna teach my baby dancin'
But I ain't no Fred Astaire.

So baby look out - I'm a man on the prowl
Look out - man on the prowl - yeah
Baby, baby, baby look out - man on the prowl.

Baby come home
I'm on the loose and I'm looking for trouble
Baby come home - oh yeah
Cause I'm a man on the prowl
So honey come home - come home
Cause I'm a man on the prowl - yeah
Man on the prowl.
"Radio Ga Ga" (Taylor)I'd sit alone and watch your light
My only friend through teenage nights
And everything I had to know
I heard it on my radio
Radio.

You gave them all those old time stars
Through wars of worlds - invaded by Mars
You made 'em laugh - you made 'em cry
You made us feel like we could fly.

So don't become some background noise
A backdrop for the girls and boys
Who just don't know or just don't care
And just complain when you're not there
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio.

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!

We watch the shows - we watch the stars
On videos for hours and hours
We hardly need to use our ears
How music changes through the years.

Let's hope you never leave old friend
Like all good things on you we depend
So stick around cos we might miss you
When we grow tired of all this visual
You had your time, you had the power
You've yet to have your finest hour
Radio - Radio.

All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio goo goo
Radio ga ga
All we hear is Radio ga ga
Radio blah blah
Radio what's new?
Radio, someone still loves you!
"Tear It Up" (May)
Are you ready? - well are you ready?

Give me your mind baby give me your body
Give me some time baby let's have a party
It ain't no time for sleepin' baby
Soon It's Round Your Street I'm Creeping

Break it up - let me go.

Shake it up
Make it up - as you go along.

Tear it up

Human Body (1980)
Words and music by
Roger Taylor.


They were talking in whispers
In bear skins and fur
Captain Scott and his heroes to be
To have laboured so long
To have made it this far
Ooh it's been such a long ride
Ooh you know it's been along way
For a human human human
For a human body you see
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
Do you believe do you believe or really care?
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
To a human human
With a human body you see


There ain't nobody gets out of this moonlight
Today is surisingly fair
Oh oh oh oh woo woo


We've got problems the Lone Ranger can't fix
The invisible man couldn't see
It takes a tough guy
To learn some new tricks
Ooh it takes such a long ride
Ooh it's been such a long way
For a human human human
For a human body you see
Can you believe it happens?
Now it happens here
To a human human
To a human body you see


You know it's been such a long while
It's been such a long while
Takes such a long time
It takes such a long time
It's been such a long way
Such along time
It's been such a long while
Been such a long way
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!
It's gonna be a long ride
I Go Crazy (1983)
Words and music by
Brian May


I took my baby dancing to see a heavy band
But I never saw my baby 'til the encore
She had the singer by the hand
I didn't wanna cry 'cause I had to be cool
I didn't wanna tell you that you're much to cruel
Did you have to run off with that dog-gone fool?


All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby


I wouldn't mind the postman if the neighbours didn't know
Or the gas man the electric man - man to fix the car
I'd have to let it go
But you had to bring me down for a rock 'n roll clone 
Leave me like a sucker standing all alone
Did you have to run off with that rolling stone?


All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby


So I ain't gonna go and see the Rolling Stones no more no more


I don't wanna go and see Queen no more no more


Now I don't wanna hurt you like you been a-hurting me
But you know that I'll be watching
Rolling on the floor next time you're on TV
Had enough of your pretending that you know where it's at
Coming on to all the boys like a real spoilt brat
To think that I nearly let you get away with all that
No way man


All I gotta do is think about you
Ev'ry night and day I go crazy
All I gotta do is get my hands on you
You better stay away from me baby
Lost Opportunity
Every morning, I face the sun
I lift my head and smile at everyone
Every afternoon you'll find me workin' on
I've got my new shoes on
Got to keep movin' on (that's what they say)
But every night I'm tossed
I shake my fevered brow
Thinking of my lost opportunity

Yes every morning I face the sun
I get so positive with everyone
But every afternoon, the cracks start showing through
They know what I'm going through (Oh yes they do)
And every evening finds me
The optimist behind me
Gone with my lost opportunity
See What A Fool I've Been (1974)
Words and music by
Brian May


Well she's gone gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
For so long
See what a fool I've been


Didn't leave no letter didn't leave no warning
I guess I'm all to blame oh Lord
Guess I'm all to blame.


My little dog ain't too hungry he kept on barking
Said it just don't seem the same
It just don't seem the same


Well I got so lonely
Went and told my neighbour
She said mm mm mm mm mm
Oh Lord what a fool I've been
And she told me what to do


Well she's gone gone this morning
See what a fool I've been
For so long
See what a fool I've been
